"I have friends who are in the James Madison program at MSU. Based on what I saw in the halls, I’m not surprised. The only thing that’s conservative there is the name itself.

"The insanity from the “progressives” seems to grow every day.  New York has had the MOST Covid cases of any state by a large margin, they have had the Most Covid deaths of any state. New York City alone has had such a large number of cases that the CDC counts them separate from the rest of the state.  The mortality rate in New York is one of the highest, with a rate multiple times higher than the U.S. average.  New York was basically the only state, other than New Jersey who DIDN’T flatten their curve.
