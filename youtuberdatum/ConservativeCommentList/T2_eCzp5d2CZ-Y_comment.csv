"Ummm. That&#39;s not how the tax system works. Although I&#39;m not for taxes of the poor, you don&#39;t get taxed at the 62% for below $400k, just for over.<br />So if you made $400,001.00. you&#39;d only pay 62% of that one dollar, so $0.38. not $248,000.62. To say you&#39;re not going to take a raise because that puts you over the $400k &quot;limit&quot; is plain stupid.<br />Even Jeff Bezos only pays 10% his first $9,875 too.<br />Taxes are a tiered system.<br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the new tax plan of Biden&#39;s is stupid too. But everyone loves to go after the 1%, which in Virginia is only going to affect the top 1%.<br />Here&#39;s the current tiers:",Anon Nymous,2021-04-23T08:26:55Z,0

"Sounds like communism. This will take away the incentive from people who want to be successful in their industry. say if your family make 400k. With this 60 percent tax, why would anyone want to put more of their money at risk just to receive 40 percent of anything above 400?. Say you made 600k that year. Of that 600k, 200k will be charged 40 percent. This means you will get 80k cash for that 200k bet profit you made plus whatever is left from the first 400k. But try to focus the amount that’s ok vet 400k. Considering most business net around 15-25 percent profit. This means you need to make about 1million extra in sales in order to take home extra 80k..... and In order to create that 1m sales? How much money do you think you need to invest in order to make that extra 1m sales? Most successful local small businesses don’t have the money for a team of lawyers to help them get away from paying taxes like what Amazon did. Lazy won’t complaint because it doesn’t effect them.

That&#39;s what the 2nd amendment is for.<br /><br />If you choose Biden and he will win, I don&#39;t know how the Middle East and African countries are going to be.<br /><br />That&#39;s why Trump doesn&#39;t want war and is pulling military members home.<br /><br />Trust me.",niko skyrnd,2020-11-03T17:26:11Z,0

However if you get a job &amp; get raises every 6 months then you will make more $$$$. Then you aren&#39;t dependent upon corrupt politicians. Then if you work hard you will be given better positions at said job, which means more $$$$... You then get company car, company cell phone, really good health, dental insurance...

The part about taxes is basically socialism they write a number make you believe you make that money but they control your money through taxes that most citizens &amp; cities never see because by the time your local &amp; state politics take their cut through third party contractors through so called consulting firs that if you dig into their records you find the political tie. Everyone knows this it’s even done with school funding but we have some groups pushing the agenda that it’s immigration issues but the truth is it’s a political problem President Trump knows because of his business background that’s why those with their hands tainted with corruption want him out. I’m not saying President Trump is perfect but I’m sure if they had something more than taxes it would be in the light. I pray that @Trump wins cause at the very least we know exactly who he is and where he stands as to the other side they make dizzy with all the flip flopping they do due to their energy bill.,claudia velazquez,2020-10-26T11:52:07Z,0

It’s scare tactics and name calling him a socialist when, in fact, he wrote the crime bill and voted for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan the same way as his republican colleagues did. Look at his voting record and show me one thing he’s supported that could be considered socialist. Last time I checked, Obamacare was originally a republican idea backed by conservative Republicans like newt gingrich. The democrats stole that plan which is why the republicans don’t even have a plan for healthcare. Costs are still going up because both parties are absolutely garbage. Also, under the trump tax plan there is a net increase in taxes over ten years for individuals making less than $75K. Things were okay especially the economy but this virus has shown trump is unfit to lead as unemployment is now at the highest since the Great Depression. He was so careless, he got the virus himself.

"Great video as always guys. I wanted to point out something that I think needs to be said.  I live in upstate NY.  I have my whole life. <br /><br />In the last governors election Cuomo won only 14 of the 62 counties in the state.  Only 6 of which could be considered &quot;upstate&quot;.  The rest was basically Long Island and NYC. <br /><br />I guess I wanted to say that there is a shift going on.  I think the state is turning more red. I know it is tough to live here (I live in the Adirondack Park) and we have the highest rate of mental illness per capita in the state in the county I live in. I worked for years through a county funded program with families and saw a lot of it first hand.<br /><br />Unemployment is high here as many jobs are seasonal and we are highly regulated because we live in the Adirondack Park. Many just go into the welfare system and then stay there.  Their kids learn that and stay there too many times. So the poverty level is high.  <br /><br />But I am staying.  We can&#39;t all leave, like you guys said.  Been fighting for my home state for years and I will continue to. I love my home.  I am not sure if you guys have ever been here, but if you came, you would understand what I am talking about.  It is a special place. Like no other.  <br /><br />Anyway, keep it up guys.  We support you 100%  Thank you for what you do.",Kenny Stonitsch,2020-10-23T12:21:10Z,0

"I don&#39;t have a problem with free education and free medical. I think education and medical should be part of our basic human rights especially here in America. I make too much money to qualify for Obamacare and Medicare but I can&#39;t afford high insurance cost that is reasonable.  I watch all my money from my little paycheck go to student loans, rent, bills social security etc. I&#39;m paying through taxes things that I can&#39;t even use. Reasonable health insurance for myself would be around $404  a month! I might as well get free medical and free education from my taxes and be able to actually use it.

They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life.”<br /><br /><br />2 Peter 3:9 NIV<br />“The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”<br /><br /><br />Jesus Christ came for a reason: <br /><br />No. 1, to take your punishment. God the Father because of His incredible love for you punished Jesus in your place. Jesus Christ died and went to hell in your place to pay the price for your sins, so that you don’t have to. <br /><br />No. 2, Jesus Christ, God in human flesh, came to make you like Him, to give you His Life, eternal life in the place of your human life. He came to replace your human life with Eternal life which is the very life of God.<br /><br />No. 3, Jesus Christ came to make you right with God, by giving you His nature of righteousness in the place of your human nature! Your human nature is what cause you to sin and to love sin. The human nature is actually the sin nature and this nature of sin that is at work in every human being and it is the reason why every human being has to be born again by God’s Spirit, the Holy Spirit. Until you are born again of God’s Spirit you cannot go to heaven, IT IS ILLEGAL because sin through the sin nature is at work in you. No sinner (a person with the nature of sin) is allowed in heaven, only the just, only the righteous (people with God’s nature of righteousness) are citizens of heaven. So this is why Jesus came on earth and died on the cross, He died to replace the nature of sin that is at work in you with His nature of Righteousness which is the very nature of God.<br /><br /><br />This is God’s free gift for every man and woman who will accept it because He loves you so much and He wants to be a part of your life, He wants to have a loving relationship with you. God wants you to become a part of His household, He wants you to become a part of His family.<br /><br />Thee most foolish and painfully disastrous decision a person could ever make is rejecting Jesus Christ’s act of love and taking a chance with hell and with the lake of fire. Mind you, hell and death itself will be thrown into the lake of fire. Please, don’t be part of those who will be condemned into the lake of fire. Why take the punishment that Jesus Christ already took for you? Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour today!<br /><br /><br />Here is proof that God is real and a testimony from an ex-satanist.

"Was an avid watcher since the start. I suppose it doesn’t matter in the grand scheme but I won’t be consuming y’all’s content anymore.<br /><br />It’s not that y’all are conservative, I absolutely respect a difference of political belief. But this guy in office is a criminal, has been proven to be a liar, cheat etc many times over. So this vote isn’t about political alignment (Besides Biden is as center-left as they come) it’s about the moral compass of this country’s future.<br /><br />Taxes have always had in built ways to write stuff off to lower liability. I’ve been in finance for years and know this. Under Trumps tax cut, where he slashed the corporate rate down to 21% from 35% touting trickle down benefits, what did the companies do?<br /><br />They spent a majority of the cuts on stock buybacks, NOT on the American middle class.<br /><br />I’m disappointed in y’all.",Sammy Angel,2020-10-22T12:32:11Z,0

Now, on THIS ballot, we have prop 207 and 208 that increases taxes on everyone who makes over $250,000 and makes marijuana legal everywhere except the workplace (which means they can drive high- I have a friend who knows someone who was killed by a driver who was under the influence) and then taxes that marijuana to apparently fund education. Our education doesnt need funding, we need proper treasurers and financial advisors and city council members who don&#39;t lie to their citizens.

This is so sad that people donor realize your tax works in brackets. Each part of your wage gets taxes by each rate until you exceed to the next margin. <br /><br />No one actually pays the true percentage  they say. People really speak out of pure ignorance. <br /><br />Let’s say you are charge at these rates.<br /><br />$100 = 10% <br />$200 = 20% <br />$300 = 30%<br /><br /> <br />If you make $350. Then this is how you get taxes.<br />$101-$200 would get taxed at 10%<br />$201-$300 would be taxed at 20%<br />Then the remaining $301- $350 would be taxed at 30% <br /><br />Simple math would give you the amount of taxes taken out.

However the government changed its term to “carbon pricing “ which means they can now consider it a “goods and service” which they then tax. So on my gas bill I pay for my gas usage, I pay between five and 20 dollars for carbon price, and Then pay 15% tax on that 5-20 dollars. Now that’s just one bill.  “Carbon pricing” is on my power bill it’s also at the gas pumps it’s affecting our grocery pricing because everything is delivered on trucks and it is devastating or agricultural industries.

"There are 150 billionaires backing Biden with $568.9M in traceable donations. Surely they are eager to swallow that &quot;only taxing the rich&quot; tax plan for our sake. Billionaires with no economic interest, so they must be smart, right?<br /><br />The billionaire backers own the corporations and they&#39;re not just gonna swallow that tax increase pill with love. Nope. They&#39;ll counter the higher taxes by raising prices on everything we buy. The $400k earners are your local small businesses, doctors, mom&amp;pop shops, attorneys, restaurants, A/C service, auto repair shops, etc. A tax increase will require a price increase or it will just force them to close down.

These same government officials control the police and judicial system so they continue to get away with their crimes, don&#39;t fall for the lie, look at history and ask why has Joe Biden been in politics for 47 years and not accomplished anything other than enrich his own family and position of power, Why? And Why did it take a Washington outsider like President Trump to finally cut through all the regulations to get our country back on track? Huge Corporations that lobby for regulations write these regulations and find a friendly face in Congress to back them labeling them as protection for the public good when in fact they limit competition for the corporations and industries that are gutting our manufacturing and job sectors sending jobs overseas.

"50 cent doesn&#39;t want to be called 15 cent. Lol. And I don&#39;t blame him. If anyone believes that only the people who earn over $400 grand will pay 50-60-62% or more, they don&#39;t know economics. The rich legally hide most of their money. They also make a lot of money in capital gains, not yet subject to income taxes. And as the twins said, those types of taxes curb the incentive to earn over $400 grand, thereby productivity and investment. That means that the Democrats will need to make up the shortfall. HOW??? If they try and keep their promises, EVERBODY, who earns over $30-40K a year, will pay up. That actually goes even if not one single rich person hides even a penny. (Six trillion bucks and more in new taxes!!! People really don&#39;t realize how much money that is.) That is a reason why socialism does not work and becomes suffering for the populace. Think about this, FACT: Socialism, communism, and the like have killed over 100,000,000 (one hundred million) people over the last 100 years—many from starvation. I just put a deposit down on a house because I am moving out of NYC (and state). I&#39;m not even waiting to sell my NYC property. After I  move, I&#39;ll sell it. Yes, people, don&#39;t hate me, but that is what wealthy people will do when possible and are already doing. How did the wealthy get wealthy? ANOTHER HINT: Not by being stupid. They leave that up to the poor.  (I put up with NYC taxes because I loved this city. A communist mayor singlehandedly destroyed it, and it is not any fun anymore. Also,  I now realize that I can work from anywhere I can get an internet connection.) (I am not blowing my own horn here. To be honest, I lost plenty of money on hair brain ideas and investments, but I made some too.)",bigbadlee1,2020-10-21T20:10:01Z,0

We are saving the earth but we are buying more consumables then every only thing is they come from China now who does not pay any tax because they just scam customs and help you avoid vat to crush the local retail. because leftists in Europe the world is saved for our children but I think they forgotten the reason they are wealthy and got the chance to do what they want was because their parents enabled them with massive amounts of accumulated wealth which they destroyed pretty fast and transfered to China.  We cannot even have an overview of Chinese companies here, 750k euro grants you a Maltese passport which instantly makes you an European and you have free acces across Europe and no local authority can stop you.

"The whole tax thing is weird to me. On the surface, the Left saying that those with more money should pay more taxes in order to benefit those with less money makes sense but, as with most things on the Left, when you look more closely it falls apart. I mean, first off, you paying more taxes means you have to trust the Government to actually use those taxes properly. People see stuff like &quot;we will spend $2bn on building new affordable homes&quot; and they think &quot;great&quot;! But when it comes to building those &quot;new affordable homes&quot; Governments almost always waste their $2bn with expensive contracts on projects which never quite come to fruition and so on. And who is benefiting from these construction contracts? Well, who knows really. It used to be the Mafia in New York, which probably says it all about how dodgy construction contracts are. Why do people think that rich people, high earners, are automatically taking money out of the pockets of poor people? These high earners tend to keep money in circulation, they buy and sell property, they provide jobs, they invest, they help fuel the economy - all of which benefits those who are less well off. If you say to these high earners that they must give over 60% of their income to the Government, you are basically diverting their money away from being spent in their communities, in the economy, toward a Government who generally wastes it. I&#39;m British, so I can&#39;t give direct examples in the US (but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all seen them) but let me give you an example from over here in London. We give our taxes to both Government and local councils so that they will spend a proportion on improving our roads and, supposedly, reducing our emissions. I live in an area of London called Islington (run by Labour incidentally, the British Democrats) and there is a major intersection in the area known as Highbury Roundabout, where 4 main thoroughfares come together. The traffic has always been busy there, but it always used to flow reasonable well. About 10 years ago they decided to &quot;improve&quot; this intersection. They redesigned the road layout and got to work. It took them a full year to complete, causing all sorts of congestion in the meantime. Having completed the construction they then decided more maintenance needed doing and they began a whole new project on the same spot, probably taking another year to complete. Once that was done they seemed to decide their new road layout was no good for cyclists or something, so they tore it up and put it back how it was before, taking another however long. Long story short, the intersection has been changed multiple times, it is now an ENTIRELY new layout with empty cycle lanes taking up half the road space, 10 years later they are STILL doing construction there and traffic (thus emissions) is worse than ever. This is what they want to increase our taxes for? I would have preferred to not give them the money, forcing them to stick to 1 plan, and leave the rich folk (who have very little direct impact on my life) to spend their money and boost our economy personally. I don&#39;t really understand why the Left hates on private business wealth so much and yet endorses flushing money down the Government drain, fattening the pockets of bureaucrats and politicians instead? Then I look at charities. In my opinion, charities do FAR more for the needy than the Government, and most of the biggest philanthropists happen to be those wealthy folk you want taxed at over 60%! What do you think happens to those donations? I can tell you that, when a high earner is spending a large portion of his income on his extortionate expenses, and when much of his excess he gives to charities, it won&#39;t be his expenses which lose out when the taxman comes knocking.",secretspurs,2020-10-21T16:56:11Z,0

"Do the math! Even with those increased tax rates on the wealthy it still does NOT make enough to pay the bills. WAKE UP PEOPLE! If every cent was taken from every wealthy person it still would not cover all the bills. Bidens plan is absolute falsehood! It is self-destructive.  It will not work no matter what. Do the numbers, they don&#39;t lie. Look at the cities the left controls, ALL are falling economically! Biden will absolutely, without any doubt, raise EVERYONE&#39;S taxes. He doesn&#39;t care, just wants power and will say anything to get that power. It takes a successful business person to solve the business problems of life sustainability for all. VOTE TRUMP/PENCE 2020!   VOTE TRUMP/PENCE 2020!   VOTE TRUMP/PENCE 2020! BTW: there are 328,000,000 people in the USA today and only 1 million make over $500,000.00 a year so taking 60% would be around $300,000,000,000 per annum. in 2013 the annual government budget was: Total: 3,478,314,000,000 (it&#39;s has dramatically increased since then especially with this global pandemic). The federal deficit in 2019 was $984 billion, equal to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product.  Now, take a guess how fast those 1,000,000 people would leave the USA if you told them you were going to take half of their money?",John Arizona,2020-10-21T16:08:33Z,0

"Let&#39;s talk about &quot;free&quot; college for a minute. First off, I spent years putting myself through night school after working all day, and I can tell you that more than half of the kids in college fail out due to lack of motivation. If you google your local colleges you can actually see their graduation rates and it&#39;s LOW. Like in the 30-40% range. Most people that go to college never finish a degree and of the ones that do, there is yet another 50% or more that never work in their field of study! So many jobs require a college degree, so people feel compelled to send their kids to college, but I think that we as a society need to revisit this. What employers really need are smart employees that can think for themselves, they will not get that with many of these liberally trained college students. Smart people can be trained, but you can&#39;t turn any old Joe into a doctor, engineer or computer programmer. Paying for everyone to attend college is akin to throwing money into a toilet and flushing it away.",You X,2020-10-21T10:50:47Z,0

"These guys clearly dont understand how taxes work. Taxes are bracketed, $399k of your income would be at the lower tax rates, and ONLY the income above would be taxed higher. So no, you would not turn down a raise cause it would put you over $400k, you would just see less of that increase then the rest of your income. And often times people making over $400k are taking great advantage of society’s tools like water, workforce, internet, roadways, or any other infrastructure demanding government controlled upkeep. For example the millionaire with a nationwide shipping company moving hundreds of heavy vehicles over roads everyday SHOULD pay more towards taxes that upkeep those roads then the mcds worker that drives his single car to work once a day. This really isn’t as bad as ppl make it sound if your smart enough to understand the reality and logic of it. Only reasons you would be against this is being to dumb to understand taxes and the reality and logic behind it, or just being greedy. We’ve tried the greedy way long enough and look where we are now. Maybe we should try it the other way for 4yrs and just see how it goes. Also, its highly unlikely any of these would get implemented even if biden wins. Its just how this country works.",Lucas W,2020-10-21T10:35:07Z,0

"Biden tax plan is great, but what he must do is say what you get back (400.000 a year is more then enough). The most happy country in the world is Denmark and the other Nothern European Countries. So how does that come. Its not the taxes. Denmark has one of the highest taxes in the world. But, the people get a lot from it. Free healthcare for everybody (yeah free), You get payed to education (so FREE education, well even Getting money to study so no debt after your study and students get even payed around 900/1000 dollar a month), Free daycare for the kids, If you are unemployed you get payed your salary (so if your business, lets say restaurant blows up in Covid time, no worry you get your payment). You get a nice living with only a 37 hours work week (work-life balance), and 5 week payed vacation, if you get kids you get 52 weeks payed. And believe me, people from Denmark also have 2nd homes around the country. So they do something very very good.

"@Martin G I think you aren’t thinking as far into the future as I am. I am talking about the inevitability of all jobs being automated. I do understand that in the beginning of automation, higher wages jobs get created due to needing higher skilled workers. But I am speaking when those higher wage jobs are also taken. For example, as a programmer, years ago the community thought our job would be the only safe one in the end, till someone created ai that can now program. Although it lacks certain complexities, it will eventually beat an avid programmer like myself.",Alvin Walker,2020-10-23T22:59:25Z,0
"@Alvin Walker while I will grant you that some jobs have been essentially replaced, history has taught us much about your doomsday prediction; automation has been proven to increase worker’s productivity and raise wages thus resulting in demand for goods and services - which lends to businesses to up their hiring. This causes demand for labour skills that work in harmony to develop and execute new technologies ...I could write everyday examples you might encounter here but I don’t think we want a novel. Capitalism cannot survive without labour or wealthy individuals to create labour through supply and demand and innovation. I’m not saying it’s perfect, but we do know that through out history socialism never survives even with these present - because the first thing it does is destroy innovation.<br />People who are poor today are still better off than people 2-3 generations ago who had money. Socialism has never produced that.",Martin G,2020-10-23T22:36:03Z,0

"@Tapeworm I firmly believe most of the politicians are crooked and need kicked out. Everyone In the government needs term limits and they need to held accountable when they steal from taxpayers and abuse their position. You shouldn’t go into politics as a public servant with a decent income and come out rich! And whatever laws they pass, they should have to live with and be held to an even higher standard to help ensure they make decisions in our best interest. And yes, people should respect the president, no matter who it is for the time he, or she, is in office. Also, voter fraud should carry a stiff punishment as people, especially this year, are caught undermining the voting process.",Kristy Pickett,2020-10-25T13:37:08Z,0

"Jarrett Wells as a proportion of their income- since the poor live paycheck to paycheck and pay sales tax (some states tax food some do not), nearly everything they buy is taxed.

The middle class pay the most in taxes as a proportion of their income. I guess it depends on who is considered rich... if you make $400k a year Biden will tax you so that you’ll be down to $200k or less in income but if you make $5 million a year- you will pay the same or less (if my son is your tax lawyer...). When I was married, I stopped working b/c my entire paycheck went to taxes and day care- why bust my tail for a $100k a year when it is all taken?- we purposely went into a lower tax brackett and actually had more cash left over!!

Yes as a disabled person I don’t have to pay tax on the money they give me but I still pay property taxes. I also know that when Obama was President I didn’t get raises every year and never as much as I got for this year if you added all the raises during Obama’s reign together. So I might not have to pay taxes on the little bit of money I get to live off of but I know raising taxes are bad and in the end it will affect me. I think others are just dumb. They don’t pay any attention to what is going on until it directly affects them enough for them to be interested. If bad people are out there paying for them to vote that is when their heads will pop up. This will directly affects them in a good way and since they don’t pay attention they will just vote how they are told.,Kricket Cooper,2020-10-22T17:40:04Z,0

And the government votes  to give themselves a raise,Robert Esposito,2020-10-20T23:03:01Z,24
Good example. I was working 7 minutes away from house making $75k a year. Got head hunted and offered a job to make $130k a year but in NYC. So I took it cuz was married with 2 kids and that’s a lot of money. By the time I paid the higher tax bracket of 50%+ and the NYC state and city tax and the tolls and extra gas so I could drive 4-5 hours a day I Litterally wound up bringing home less than I was making $75k. How that works I still don’t get it. Turned out a $65k raise was actually a horrible pay decrease and and 4-5 hours longer day that destroyed my nice new car with all the miles. Bout 1000 per week. After one month I said This is bullshhhh I’m out!!!  Take it one step further. If u don’t work at all u can have $1600 for rent / $400 for food/ $300 in ur pocket cash/ free insurance &amp; utilities  / and bunch other stuff. Which is the same as a $35-40k a year job. Why both working?!?!?,Goomba999,2020-10-20T23:02:25Z,1

"I walked away from family years ago and it wasn&#39;t because of politics or even religious beliefs.  It was because of insanity.  Sometimes you have to step back and really assess the effects your family are having on your life.  It can be ugly and they will make every effort to make you feel guilty but sometimes, cutting yourself off from the rest, is the only solution.  Once I stepped away and moved on my life became so much richer and happy.  After a time I realized how much stress and aggravation the family had caused me.  I was fortunate in that my spouse and son felt the same way.  So the three of us moved on as our own family and it was great.  The son is grown now and living his own life and we are a part of his life.  The three of us have a wonderful relationship; but when we were engaged in the extended family, our relationship was strained.  It is hard, because of course you love your family; but some people can not be reasoned with.  Some people can not help but inflict emotional turbulence onto you.  We had to make a choice.   We do not regret that choice.  If family would express hate and or anger to you because of a political choice you have made; all I can suggest is that you seriously assess your family.  Something is slightly off-kilter there.  Seriously think about it.  What kind of family would hate or get angry at you for a political choice?  Sometimes your family can be more of an enemy to you than a stranger.  I read an article, years ago, by a well known (at the time) psychiatrist.  In the article she explained, family that tries to manipulate and control you through emotions; try to make you feel guilty; try to make you feel responsibility and duty to them, are in fact, turning you into an &#39;emotional hostage&#39;.  That article really opened my eyes and it was one of the things that gave me the strength I needed to pull away and live my own life.  Good luck to all of you having to suffer the emotional out-casting of your family.  Life is short, if you don&#39;t make your life a happy one, you will die an emotional. bitter, wreck.",reesa serik,2020-10-20T21:07:29Z,2

Even taxing them as low as 20% is enough to cover a lot of expenses - not to mention the taxes on people in lower brackets. Taking 60% is just excessive and where will the rest of the money go? Into the pockets of politicians.<br /><br />Furthermore, rich people will just move their base of operations and people will lose their jobs. It’s not a good idea at all.

They mentally can’t except that Trump has been trying to help their communities, but they spit at him because their white Democratic Masters have full control of every aspect of their lives. This is coming from a white American. I have no say in racial politics because I don’t believe in racial politics. We’re all American and should only be called American. Yet some “African-Americans” would rather be called by a title that shows they’re just descendants of slaves. White Democrats came up with that to separate us and show that you can’t be equal them. This has to be a version of MK Ultra that was released on us as the people of the US, and it’s sickening. WAKE UP! I expect hateful replies, but that’ll only further my point.

"So, for the record, top marginal rates do not affect your ENTIRE income, only that which falls into the top bracket of earnings<br /><br />For example, say the top marginal tax rate is 40%, and the top bracket is income levels of $400,000 and above. Say you make $500,000. You wouldn&#39;t have a nominal tax obligation of $200,000. Rather, it would be the amount paid based whatever the rate is for the brackets of income up TO the $400k threshold (the lower brackets have substantially lower tax rates), plus $20,000 (which is 40% of the $100,000 of income that is between the $400,000 threshold for the top bracket and your actual income). It&#39;s a difference of tens of thousands of dollars. <br /><br />Obviously, everyone feels differently about what the rates are, and the specific levels at which what the different brackets are set. I&#39;m not arguing one way or another about that. I just think it&#39;s important to be clear about how the progressive tax system works.",Pete,2020-10-20T18:27:43Z,3

"People unfortunately don’t fully understand how economics works and specially taxing . If you increase taxes on the rich, what is going to happen ? Rich people are going to cut their costs and they will doing that by cutting labor costs ( lower wages, benefits, and lay off ) or even worse move their assets out of the country. Moreover we are in an unstable situation right now cause of the pandemic... you can’t aggravate the economy right now you should stimulate it actually . We all agree that we need to find an equilibrium and help lower income people improve their situation, but we are talking about a big jump In taxes of any expect ( income capital gains real estate ).

Ice cube and 50 BOTH handled this wrong.  The African American portion of Bidens base are too emotional to get the bigger picture.  <br />Cube and/or 50 should request to have a public televised/streamed sit down with Trump.  Ask him all these questions from taxes to racism accusations.  Engage him directly.  The amount of voters that would shift to the right would be mind-blowing. Giving Trump the ability to answer those questions without it barked at him by a biased media head would be amazing. <br />I wish I was a celebrity or had a large platform.  I&#39;d reach out to Trump in a heartbeat and get real information out to my people.,ricky spanish,2020-10-20T16:12:39Z,7

"The tax rate affects the portion of your tax that enters that tax bracket. <br /><br />Example: you make 100k, if there are 3 tax brackets that you cross into 0-20k 20-60k and 60-100+k  and each has a particular tax rate. You pay that rate for the first 20k, then the next 40k gets taxed at the second bracket rate, then the third bracket rate covers the rest of it. So you don&#39;t actually make less money for breaking into the next tax bracket.<br /><br />Definitely not saying I&#39;m in favor of any of these taxes but its best not to spread misinformation. Getting a raise that pushes you into a new tax bracket will not cause you to make less money after taxes.",Sean Murray,2020-10-20T14:57:45Z,0

I almost ever case when someone agrees with Conservative values or policies or supports a Conservative, special if this person it of Caucasian classification, there are as you said told that they have sold out to the &quot;White Man&quot; or they are an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; or many more similar comments... well doesn&#39;t make the person who is making that statement A RACIST. I mean if we are all supposed to be seeing each other as humans and not members of a given ethnic categorization, then making a statement like &quot;sold out to the white man&quot; has to be a racist statement. I am soo tired of these ignorant self righteous morons who make racist statements while trying to accuse other people of being racist. I am thoroughly convinced that Liberals are the most racist people on this planet, hiding behind their own racist rhetoric.",Bambam NJ,2020-10-20T14:54:54Z,0

"Australian here - I had a job with the Department of Human Services (Australia&#39;s Welfare System) for six years, since I had turned 18. Once the Rona hit, in March where I am, cutbacks caused the department to drop staff at &quot;random&quot; and my name came up. From then until now I have been on Welfare legitimately struggling, feeling absolutely embarrassed to be on Welfare for so long. Last week I got a call from a job provider (the people you attend if you&#39;re on welfare who assist in looking for work) - bare in mind, this wasn&#39;t a call for me to look for work, I had applied for a job with them a month or two back and they advised me I now have a full-time job with them starting next Monday.<br />That was seven months of feeling like a dreg on society. However, I just keep trying to remind myself that there are people who have been on that particular payment for years, even decades because the welfare system here is full of loopholes and allows that laziness. <br />Going from an extremely well paying job, to welfare, now to well paying again, I will quote the Wolf of Wall Street &quot;I have been a rich man, and I have been a poor man, and I choose rich every fucking time&quot;.

The &#39;18 Midterms were the worst I&#39;ve ever seen and it was so much worse than the level of fraud I saw in &#39;16, which was pretty damned bad. <br />Let&#39;s look at just one county in CA. <br />Take San Diego County for instance which in the &#39;16 Presidential Election turned in 144% of Registered Voters Votes. <br />San Diego County, CA in &#39;16 had a little more than 1.65 million people registered to vote. That means that 44% over the actual number of registered voters resulted in at least 726,000 fraudulent votes being counted than should have even existed. This year they&#39;re reporting that they have a &quot;little more than 1.9 million people registered to vote&quot;, this is as of Oct 4 &#39;20. If we see a repeat of the &#39;16 numbers of 44% more votes counted than are even registered to vote we&#39;ll see at least 836,000 fraudulent votes in the upcoming election. That is just one county in CA and almost every single county in that state has this exact same issue, far more votes counted than they have actual legally registered voters. This is just one State you can see this play out all across the Nation as there are a good many States with issues like this or very similar... <br />These numbers kind of explain the HildaBeast&#39;s supposed popular vote win and how it was a completely fabricated total Lie..<br />Source for numbers: <a href=""https://fox5sandiego.com/news/politics/presidential-election-2020/san-diego-sees-surge-in-registered-voters-with-early-voting-set-to-start/"">https://fox5sandiego.com/news/politics/presidential-election-2020/san-diego-sees-surge-in-registered-voters-with-early-voting-set-to-start/</a><br /><br />Now look back to the &#39;18 Midterms, look no further than the AZ Senate Race. The GOP had it by 55k or so votes according to the registered voter roles of those eligible to vote and number of ballots that had been counted on election night at close of the poles. Oh and let&#39;s not forget FOX calling it 2 hours before the polls even closed which is odd to say the least. Then around 2 weeks later while all eyes were on Florida for the blatant fraud they wanted seen, look at the right hand and ignore the left, magic right. Low and behold all of a sudden enough Mail in Ballots had shown up and that AZ Senate race was overturned because magically all or most of those votes broke in favor of the Dims. Now stretch that out over the rest of the Nation where on the close of election night in the &#39;18 Midterms the GOP had only lost a total of 7, that&#39;s right 7 seats. Fast forward 2 weeks and all of a sudden magically the GOP was down a total of 47 Seats giving the Dims the Majority in the House. There are more and more cases of Voter Fraud being exposed all across this Nation with ballots being discarded in abandoned buildings, parking lots, dumpsters and ditches or hidden in the actual post offices/vehicles/trailers themselves. People would have to be blind to not see what&#39;s been happening in this Nation for the better part of 80 years or more, all the way back to the LBJ Admin and before. It&#39;s that Voter Fraud is alive and well and has only gotten much, much worse over time because they&#39;ve been allowed to get away with it over and over and over again...",Mjr Burn,2020-10-20T13:54:24Z,0

There is no perfect system like the US, political fights over healthcare are part of every campaign , and it’s abused by those coming newly into the country, like the us if your child is born in the air or on our land it gets automatic citizenship that’s another loophole I despise.",Marty K,2020-10-21T16:14:17Z,0

@Doc Louis if he raises cooperate taxes to 28% who is going to pay that? The companies? Technically yes but they will take it out of a raise employees may have gotten.... Or simply raise the price of their product.... The consumer pays that.

So if you make $500,000 you pay the 62% on the amount from $400,000 to $500,000. So, 62% on the $100,000 difference. The $400,000 and below gets taxed at the lower rate, whatever that rate is, I don’t know.

"The Hodge twins are funny, but really ignorant when it comes to taxes democratic socialism, socialism, communism, left and liberals. They conflate all of them as one. Bernie sanders does not wanna give houses, it s a gov scheme where poor families who cant afford housing, under that scheme would pay rent but at a lower cost. The hodge twins should see when the US saw its growth, under FDR where they had taxes at 70 to 90%. In the US their are so many loopholes that billionaires go through where they pay zero in taxes. When the big corporation need to be bailed out the government bails them out, taxes paid by working class people. Funny that socialism is good for them, but bad for ordinary folks.

Look at how these cities of  Baltimore, Chicago, San Francisco, LA, Portland, Seattle, etc. are run by Democrats for 30 to 70 years.  All the wealthy folks and businesses are bailing fast than fast out of those places and their states.  Who has to pick up the tab, middle class that&#39;s who.  Vote Red across the board.

"Welcome to the swedish way of living! ;) That tax money will go to finance the politicians as it does here! So, yes you can finance free education with that tax rate, but only up to college, then you are grown up and need to take a loan, or have rich parents, to be able to pay for your housing, food etc.. or for the lucky few, work during the education.<br /><br />This only effects the middle class and the low income, not just because of the tax rate, but for the increase in every day cost. Your gas prices will sky rocket, housing, food, clothing everything will be more expensive since the companies earn less so they will need to raise the prices to make up for that. The companies won&#39;t sit on their asses watching their last year profit become a loss the year after that! ROFL!<br /><br />Its not going to stop there, the green new deal will make your energy cost sky rocket and as an example when you go shopping there is going to be a plastic-bag-tax as we have here, it cost 1 dollar for a plastic bag here! Welcome, embrace it, low-mid incommers. You will have NO money left after you pay your taxes.

Tax hikes are bad but they don’t work like the twins imply  . Tax grades apply only for what you make beyond the grade . So if you make 300k and you get a raise to 400k then it is only the money you make over 400k that is taxed at the higher rate so your actual tax rate which is the money you pay in taxes as a percentage of your income gradually go up.   Never let paying taxes deter you from getting a raise !,Mr Jackson,2020-10-20T08:23:25Z,0

"The average leftist sees socialism as a way to live an easy life. It sounds good on paper. Poor people get benefits and the wealthy fund everything. The problem is that wealthy people will leave and the poor will be stuck trying to cover everything.  Look at Hong Kong right now. Hong Kong Millionaires are trying to flee to the UK because Communist China is moving in, Sino-Britain Joint Declaration Agreement be damned. The Hong Kong Millionaires are trying to get out and Communist China is trying to plug up all the holes to prevent their escape. They want their money and their economy. Leftist Socialists are just looking for a system that will just give them what they want for free.",Josh Blount,2020-10-20T07:11:57Z,0

"One common misconception is that you can make less money by going up into a higher tax bracket. At least from my few years as a working citizen, tax is done on a marginal basis. So those 62% tax rates are for every dollar over the 400k they earn. I still think that&#39;s not fair but somebody who makes 402k for example will have an effective tax rate of less than 62%. For the first 20k they earn they may pay 0%, then the next 20k they may pay 15%, then the next they may pay 20%, and so on and so on until you get to their final income.<br />So the effective tax rate that somebody who makes say 402k may be like 30-40% and not 62%.",tomonkysinatree,2020-10-20T06:13:13Z,0

Ok, ok so you get a letter stating you have a appointment to pick up the funds but you also have to meet with a fee personal finical adviser, but you decide how to spend it....how many poor blacks who never saw their sister or brother again, would assume everything is alright and would go in to pick their reparations too?

"You just don’t understand what you are talking about. I proven this in multiple responses to you.<br /><br />If each country has IT’S OWN healthcare system in Europe that is NOT the same as or even close to ALL OF AMERICA having ONE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. <br /><br />You do not have what is being proposed right now in America because you don’t have ONE BIG EU healthcare system that every single EU country is forced to use.<br /><br />So you are telling us to adopt a healthcare system that you just agreed is NOT logical to have.<br /><br />You can get quality education here in the US as well without going to massive debt. No one is forcing people here to go to these big expensive colleges. There are thousands of colleges that are cheap that are just as good as going to an expensive college. <br /><br />No we want low taxes because it does not make sense to overtax your citizens. You cannot show me a single society that collapsed because it UNDERTAXED it’s citizens but I can show you countless societies that have OVERTAXED it’s citizens. Overtaxation and oppression was the entire reason why the US was created to begin with.<br /><br />Low taxes = more money for the citizens. Why the hell is that a bad thing?<br /><br />The difference between the American and European mindset is Europeans have always sucked on the breast of the government while Americans have always been independent.<br /><br />Instead of using the government to do everything, why not just teach all of the citizens how to do for themselves?<br /><br />America was doing fine until the mid-19th century when we tried to replicate your socialist system and expanded all of these social programs which we are seeing now was a terrible idea. <br /><br />We also rebuilt your countries. <br />We pay for your military defenses. We innovate more than you.<br /><br />Additionally, we’re just doing better than you lol. We don’t want to be you. You keep telling us the problems we have but for some the ACTUAL American people that live here love being here and you EUROPEANS continue to move here.<br /><br />When Europe becomes the dominant world power, we’ll maybe listen to you.

All average+ students in my country can get quality college education without heavy debt on their back with risk if they will ever use that degree like it is in US.<br /><br />Americans want low taxes so they can buy fancy lifestyle, driving BMWs,  make more money meanwhile taking no responsibility for social problems as i mentioned. Everything in excuse that you are capitalists and nothing is free.<br /><br />I think big organisations, companies with huge budgets should take responsibility.

they are going after the common person!<br /><br /> they are actively trying to repeal prop 13. its a ca blessing that locks in property taxes to only rise a specific amount. state wants to repeal it and re asses everyone property at the higher value so they can force them to pay money. mind you highest gas taxes and poor roads. unreliable electricity. what&#39;s the point of them having the money... they never demonstrate the ability to use it responsibly.,Mr person,2020-10-20T05:38:45Z,0

"Give an inch, they’ll take a mile. <br />You’ll accept the 62% tax but try to justify it with ‘but my college education is free!’ (Even though in most cases college has become pointless) then it’ll be ‘we need to give everyone free healthcare, but we have to raise taxes’ now your taxed at 75% , then a couple Democrats and liberals later when your taxes are at 90% you’ll finally wake up and realize you’re trapped and trapped everyone else thanks to your vote .<br /><br />I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if trump lowered taxes again Or even somehow eliminated federal taxes for the 2020 tax year (we’ve been on lock down for 8/12 months and the country is barely opening , even though it is at a snails pace)<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trump2020"">#trump2020</a>",Neptune,2020-10-20T05:37:30Z,0

I&#39;ll know as ira is tax deferred but you don&#39;t have to pay taxes if you do it right. Instead of withdrawal  you borrow against it. Therefore no tax you pay 4 plus percent interest far lower the the now 35% tax but you gain not on the stock market but on the index. Therefor stock bottoms out you stay at 0 gain 0 loss. When stock goes back up you are capped between 10 and 13% so if stick goes up 40% you get 13% at most. But you don&#39;t lose in the down periods. 401k well that is tied to the stock market. Another difference an ill is indexed universal life insurance which is why you can borrow from it instead of withdraw.  Also some of them have disability etc included. Keep your money don&#39;t throw it away.,Michael Belshay SR,2020-10-20T05:17:12Z,0

You pay a national sales tax for retail goods and services. (Retail meaning new) That’s it.

But look... 399,999 you pay about 200,000 in taxes.  Now that you make 400,000 you still owe about 200,000 in taxes. You only get charged the higher taxes on 1 dollar.<br /><br /><br />However, this example has only two tax brackets.  There is a lot more, meaning this example is overestimated!

The Reason That The MSM Keeps Asking President Trump if He Loses The Election Will There Be a Peaceful Transition of Power From Trumps Administration and His Constituent&#39;s is Because They are Gonna CHEAT BIG Same Reason They Keep Saying That Biden is Way Ahead in The Polls. They Want to Make President Trump Look Bad For Contesting The Election Results ! To Claim He Has No Basis for Contesting The Results Because Biden &quot;WON&quot; By Such a Large Margin. They Know That WE THE PEOPLE are Gonna Be PISSED !!! So Don&#39;t Be Shocked By The Results Be OUTRAGGED !!!!!,Kelly Dardeen,2020-10-20T04:38:12Z,0

"This only affects people earning $400k or more per year. It will bring pre 2017 tax brackets back, so a majority of Americans taxes will only go up $1k-$2k. Tax credits will be prominent, so you will get money back. This video is misleading.

"I’m Australian, and while I don’t pay THAT much in taxes, I don’t mind paying taxes at all. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, had I been living in your part of the world, I wouldn’t have been able to pay for the diagnostic scan, let alone surgery and 6months of Chemo and endless consults and hospital visits, fertility preservation (ivf) The only cost to me through all of that, was for parking at the hospital. I had surgery within 3weeks of my diagnosis. I earn below average wage, I don’t have private health care. Taxes paid to keep me alive. <br /><br />How many people in the USA die because they cannot access healthcare?<br />How many people are bankrupted after illness or accident in the USA? <br /><br />While I think 60% is too high, stop thinking of yourselves for a moment, and think about those in your communities who struggle to survive without the stresses of illness? <br /><br />My university education cost money, but a bachelor degree in nursing when I went to uni a few years ago cost me a total of $30k, the rest subsidised through taxes. The roads I drive on, paramedics who show up for free to save your life, that’s paid by taxes too. The police who (mostly) serve and protect, taxes pay their wages too. <br /><br />I get your argument, but I also get that most people don’t earn close to $400k, so really it’s the wealthy and powerful who have the opportunity to help others have a much more meaningful quality of life. <br /><br />Don’t be selfish dicks. <br /><br />Btw I wouldn’t vote Biden even if I was a US citizen.

To an average person earning $30k or something, this sounds fine by them because it doesn&#39;t effect them. They&#39;ll see someone still earning $130k per year  without seeing what&#39;s involved in making that money and think it&#39;s a lot of money.<br />Personally, I think that rich people should pay more tax but it&#39;s the same old same old - look to the Nordic countries and say how much tax they pay but the US isn&#39;t Norway. Norway is about 15-20% more expensive (obvs. varying by what you&#39;re buying).<br />It&#39;s the same old thing - those without want what those with have. That&#39;s fine by me when it&#39;s the likes of universal healthcare and housing (by which I mean a roof over your head and not a free home or apartment) but it&#39;s not that which they&#39;re after it&#39;s money in their hand for whatever they want and then when they have it they&#39;ll say it&#39;s not enough!",Legendary Hamster,2020-10-20T04:27:30Z,0

Tesla needs to move to Texas.<br />When you stress people out, they are more likely to loose their jobs and basically lose their shit over things that don&#39;t mater but do when that the money isn&#39;t there, because their always looking over their shoulder to see if any one is ready to stab them in the back for what little their making.. and as with Obama, people were working up to 3 jobs because their wage and the amount of hours were stressing those people.. and their families.. and the younger people.. given no hope when they see what other people around them are stressed over.. as is why you had those like Travon Martin end up dead.. wanting to have what he had to try and take off some one else, that was a hopeless future... a democrat future.<br />Reality of higher crimes is from people without work.. or of the reality of seeing no future in any job because of the situation of worth while wages against having it taken by the government.. by them over spending on a military stand over tactic.. to the rest of the world... but that then have to have people to spend their money to solve the problem that government is willing to put everyone into... it didn&#39;t work for Hitlers Germany.. they over spent on social programs while not paying their national debt.. the banks recalled on their loans making Germany so broke that they ventured into WW2.. what people need to ask.. hasn&#39;t any one learnt from history .",Frank Blackcrow,2020-10-20T03:56:04Z,0

The US already double hits the rich who make money outside the USA. They pay taxes in the country they made the money in and the USA charges taxes on the money earned as well so you would have to accept citizenship in another country and renounce your USA Citizinship or you would pay taxes outside US and they would take another 62% of the profits before insurance, etc. They will drive all the companies and Jobs out of the USA and the high paying jobs would go with them, That is what they want so then the people must rely on govenment to live Socialism 101.",Rebel Soul,2020-10-20T03:34:13Z,2

"For those of you who are retiring, consider leaving your money in your 401-K plan (if you can), and draw it out slowly to supplement your income.  If you can live off the compound interest only, your money will last forever and work for you when you quit working.  Make sure you know where the line is concerning the tax rates and where you fall.  I made a ton of money in my plan with the experts running it, why would I change that if I don&#39;t have to?  If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it!  <br /><br />It&#39;s critical that you choose the right plan, at the right time (ASAP), and contribute AT LEAST what they match, but max it out when you can!  My motto is, &quot;Live on 1/2 of what you make, save and invest the rest!&quot;<br /><br />Another consideration is, when you turn 65 and sign up for Medicare, Medicare goes back 2 years to determine how much to charge you for their services.  It&#39;s variable every two years (I think).  Example, if you choose to downsize and sell your house when you&#39;re 63, Medicare will consider that as your income and charge you accordingly when you turn 65 two years later.   Selling when you&#39;re 62 may be a better plan and could save you money in the long run.<br /> <br />One more pearl......when you die and your kids inherit your 401-K, they MAY not have to draw it out all at once.  They can leave it in, and draw it out at a minimum of $10,000 a year.  By leaving it in for as long as they can, they can supplement their income, and continue to enjoy the compound interest which hopefully, is what you were doing.  Teach your children how to handle their money.  <br /><br />Disclaimer...........I&#39;m not an expert, but I play on on YouTube!  😎  Be nice guys, it&#39;s just food for thought.",Two Feathers,2020-10-20T03:29:55Z,0

"What I don&#39;t think most people understand is inflation lags m2. So in the future when the bubble pops and hyper inflation kicks in people will have to be paid much higher salaries to do the same jobs or they will not be able to maintain a lifestyle. This means that minimum wage will be raised but it wont buy anymore than it does now. The people making $100,000 could easily be paid $400,000 for the same work because the dollar is going to be massively devalued. When you devalue currency (notice I didn&#39;t say money) it requires more to purchase the same stuff if the economy adjusts and the tax rate was set before it adjusts guess who was just pushed into a higher tax bracket. You! The chart below shows M2 and inflation over time. Remember inflation lags M2. M2 is money supply. Which should be called C2 for currency supply.

@Chisato Madison no actually welfare hurts several countries. Welfare is a socialist ideal. Russia has had to restart there government 4 times over there ideals failed them. China several times. Venezuela is failing. From 1980 to 2014 world poverty has increased from 35 percent to over 48 percent its not gone down its actually gone up. And for instance in Canada the country&#39;s debt has risen by 40 percent since welfare started and poverty has only increased in in Canada. On top of that 45 percent of Canadians travel to untied states to use our health care. Let&#39;s talk about the UK since welfare has started there debt has climb up and additional 52 percent over 48% travel to other countries for medical. When a government gets involved it causes more issues than solves. Capitalism creates a free market that allows people to grow evenly. If you actually do your research you will see that it doesn&#39;t work it fails every time. Let me be honest I want to help the world I hate seeing people suffer no one likes it but these policies sound great they just don&#39;t work it hasn&#39;t worked and its causing grief all over the world.,Rubber Ducky,2020-10-22T22:15:46Z,0

"@Rubber Ducky Actually welfare has largely taken people out of poverty, the world isn&#39;t just the US. In my country poverty was even worse before there was a safety net in place. You are wilfully ignorant if you think unfettered capitalism isn&#39;t going to harm vulnerable people. It makes literally no sense. MLK and Malcolm X criticized capitalism, there&#39;s nothing republican about that, who are very pro capitalism. Again, many republicans want to abolish welfare, doing so will leave people unable to work with nothing. In my country, simply cutting welfare has been extremely damaging for many people, let alone getting rid of it. So yes, right wingers are prejudice toward disabled people, because they enact policies knowing it&#39;s going to screw them over. It&#39;s called economic slavery. Some of our MP&#39;s have flat out called them &quot;economic burdens&quot;.",Chisato Madison,2020-10-22T20:10:15Z,0

"@Nathan Maged the initial hike on the &quot;rich&quot;($400k+) bracket is just what the twins said. It&#39;s a starting point to syphon wealth off the wealthy and lead into more taxes for everyone. These blind dems are so braindead they don&#39;t see the writing on the walls. They believe that taxing the wealthy will help them somehow, but in reality it will only give the government more power over their lives so when they finally realize they&#39;re powerless, it&#39;s far too late.

We have a liberal governor at the moment and I really believe people are moving further out to get away which will push those Who are closer to the city in our direction currently and they will not be people we want to live next to. <br /> And now more than ever with the liberal scum next to us Who moved in after us and decided this is their neighborhood. We’re hoping to have ours on the market in the spring time no matter who wins this election. <br />We live in a decent neighborhood and for the first time heard gunshots go off way too close for comfort twice in one week.

"First, the same article said individuals earning less than $400k (couples earning less than $800k) would tend to pay LESS taxes under the plan.  Second, people do not understand how Tax Brackets work.  Even if you make $100M in a year, you still pay the same 10% Federal Income Tax on the first $10k you make, then you only pay 12% on the $ you make between $10k and $40k, and so on.  If you pay the 37% rate, it’s only because you are making over $518k and you only pay 37% on the $ over $518k.  Biden is not proposing a 62% Federal Tax Rate by any means, and the article was even being a bit speculative and careful to say it “could” happen in NY, NJ, and CA but even so, a 62% rate in those states (combined Federal and State, and Biden has no say over State taxes) would only apply to the $ made over a certain amount.  Basically you would be rich af, have made a ton of $ that got taxed at a low rate, and then only the $ you made way above what 99% of the people in America make would get taxed higher, and clearly anyone affected would use 401k, IRA, and other Corporate Stock plans/options and other tax shelters, and these people make tons of $ at lower capital gains tax rates from long term equities, as well as shelter $ with “white lies” on their taxes about valuations of real estate (cough-cough-Trump-cough!), so let us not feel bad when a man makes $87M a year instead of $100M and everyone else gets to pay lower taxes??",J RP,2020-10-20T02:30:30Z,1

I am an American currently living on the German economy and it’s basically a socialist economy.Refugees  get taken care of better than the actual citizens paying taxes. The German citizens who work there whole life get crumbs for retirement but someone seeking asylum from certain countries abuse the system and get buckets of money for free. Don’t get me wrong there are those that use the system the right way but I can go on how they use that social system to their advantage and I can’t even blame them. Even with me paying German taxes I still have to pay my own health insurance and don’t get much benefits. You already know where I am going back to it’s not worth it.

"My ex wife is one of the hardest working people ive ever known and she busted her ass to get through college.  She told me how it was super hard but she wanted to set herself up to be able to make a living (chose a career to be able to do that) and worked hard to achieve that goal.  And she told me there were times where it felt so overwhelming she wanted to give up but knew she couldn’t because she had to pay for the schooling she got and was stuck with that bill whether she graduated or not.  And she wasnt going to not get what she wanted.  Her point being that imagine now you make college FREE, and you get a bunch of idiot modern day kids going for FREE and seeing how difficult it is...they are all just gonna drop out, waste all that time and energy and resources because they aren’t being held responsible for their choices and go off and screw around.  That kind of set up would cheapen and devalue the college experience and ruin it for those that actually WANT a spot in these classes because they are motivated but lost out to a loser that took that spot and quit.

Gas tax, property tax, food tax, goods and services tax (restaurants, a car, Pine-Sol, jewelry, furnishings) all those things you use. Yep, wait there&#39;s more. Now Government mandated &quot;taxes&quot;. These include your drivers license, your tags you pay for your car, services like your drivers license renewel, car tags and registration, Insurance your required to have for your car and property, rental fee levies if you rent a home. It just goes on and on and on. You might say, &quot;But it&#39;s only for people making more than 400k a year. Guess what, those 400k earners will be leaving California in droves. Now they have to make lost revenue up by hitting the 200k earners, then the 100k earners, you get the point. Now let&#39;s cover local taxes like city and county taxes, about an additional 12-15%. But wait...there&#39;s more. All those little regulatory taxes like your water bill, your cell phone bill and cable bill. Have you ever looked at all those &quot;fees&quot; they charge you (regulatory fees, disposal fee, FCC fee, clean air fee, FEC fee.... these are all actually TAXES!, but they call them fees, this way you can&#39;t write them off on your taxes. Oh, don&#39;t forget about all those little hidden &quot;Fees&quot;, these are prominent with Government services. That little fee you pay to file papers with the courts, those fees you pay to go watch a Lakers game, those fees you pay to apply for an apartment or a new car, those fees you pay to get your power, water, gas turned on. ALL TAXES DISGUISED AS &quot;FEES&quot;.

"Not even have to be famous, farmers make a good amount but they put a lot in to grow food or meats, Cali is ranked 7 as a distributor, this bill passes well they’ll be a lot of closed farms which means less food from here which means prices go up in other states, it just ruins everyone future, no one will wanna be a doctor if they make more then that now",Gunner Lucero,2020-10-20T02:16:03Z,0
"And not to mention taxing guns, bullets, cars, etc.  Hell, if I buy something and paid sales tax and then I want to sell that same item at a loss on ebay, I have to pay sales tax on it again.  Income taxes used to be illegal according to the constitution.  You basically paid property tax and that&#39;s it.  All government does is slowly erode your money, assests, and rights.  And once you give it to them, good luck on getting it back!  Everybody in America should be voting Republican straight down the line.

I have a simple fix for the tax plan...  IF you just hold your money (like many &#39;stars&#39; ) and buy cars &amp; boats &amp; houses... then you get the 50% fed rate.  BUT if you have a business that Employs PEOPLE you can write it down.  Corporate rate will be set to match the &quot;socialist&quot; Nordic nations.

"I like what Trump is doing for America. It just makes sense. Lower taxes for corporations (even though people bitch about it) Corporation&#39;s move INTO America. More corporation that move into America means they by default pay more taxes(1 corp, + 1 corp = 2 Corp paying taxes). And what do they need? People to work for them. Jobs created. Jobs created means more taxes paid by working people. Now that he has gotten more corporations in and more people working he can lower taxes for the middle class. Biden wants to cut the Trump tax cuts for the middle class, which on average means a man, wife, and one child pay about $3,000 more in taxes each year. Then you add a $4 Trillion dollar tax on corporations and people making over $400,000 (about 1% of the population) corporations move out (jobs lost) and I&#39;m not even getting into what will happen to the stock market, prices of products like food, cars, houses etc.",Mark 15Vintage,2020-10-20T01:48:55Z,0

Heck, a lot of us who have done entrepreneurship with free enterprise opportunity failings at times have needed to file bankruptcy as it&#39;s the safety net in free enterprise market capitalism.  Life happens.  Trump as President at least wants to get bootstraps to citizens so they can pull themselves up via hard &amp; smart work with opportunity, not just having it given to them in a convoluted way by jacking up taxes higher than what&#39;s reasonable soaking so-called &quot;rich&quot; people.  Yes, richer people have the wherewithall to pay more, and typically do because they have the means to, but not exorbitantly to the point it disincentivices their ability to not only make money but also the job opportunities they provide.  Do people really just want the government to take over beyond reason and further socialize the U.S. marketplace as Biden&#39;s policy plans lean toward doing??

Damn it&#39;s about time people did the math on the Biden tax plan.,G Daddy,2020-10-20T01:17:03Z,255
"@Daniel Martinez The math that isn&#39;t done is the math that excludes many of the unfunded programs the party wants, the loss of tax revenues to jobs and industry going overseas. Not to mention is they get their way regarding oil? That will cripple the economy. Right now 10% of the population is paying 70% of all taxes. Bottom line is there&#39;s going to be an enormous short fall and where do you think that will come from? And besides that ... who would aspire to start businesses and grow companies if they knew they&#39;d have to pay 2/3 of their income in taxes? His theories on redistribution of wealth has never worked and never  will work. It creates the ruling class and us serfs.",G Daddy,2020-11-14T22:30:04Z,0
"Well they have the numbers all wrong. Any income over, I repeat, OVER 400k could get taxed up to 62%. Anything under 400k gets taxed at a slightly lower rate than you are paying right now under Trump. Here is an example. Make 500k a year? Of that 500k, 100k, will be taxed at a max 62% so you pay 62k in taxes from that 100k. The remaining 400k gets taxed at the normally as you would under Trump but it will be slightly less. 95% of Americans do not make anywhere near 400k a year and if you cannot google the true tax plan from Bidens own plan, you will never make close to 400k a year.",Daniel Martinez,2020-11-14T22:04:50Z,1

Then became the leader of the free world  ... and the only thing the other guy did was get reelected (his most important job BTW) and he never worked for anything he got. Ok ... I&#39;m decided ...

"Abraham Lincoln was as anti-United States as anyone could be. <br /><br />&quot;Anyone who has read The Real Lincoln (or scanned the ,&quot;King Lincoln Archive&quot; at LewRockwell.com) would not be surprised at all to hear that Lincoln was hated and reviled by most of the &quot;great men&quot; (and the Northern masses) of his time. As Tagg hesitantly admits in his Introduction, Lincoln was widely criticized in the North as a &quot;bloody tyrant&quot; and a &quot;dictator&quot; for his &quot;arbitrary arrests, the suspension of habeas corpus, and the suppression of newspapers . . .&quot; More specifically, imprisoning tens of thousands of Northern civilians without due process for verbally opposing his policies; shutting down over 300 opposition newspapers; deporting an opposing member of Congress; confiscating firearms and other forms of private property; intimidating and threatening to imprison federal judges; invoking military conscription, income taxation, an internal revenue bureaucracy, and huge public debt; and ordering the murder of hundreds of draft protesters in the streets of New York City in July of 1863 are all good reasons why Lincoln was so widely despised.&quot;--Thomas DiLorenzo, How the Lincoln Myth Was Hatched",Tom Goffnett,2020-10-20T15:25:33Z,0
