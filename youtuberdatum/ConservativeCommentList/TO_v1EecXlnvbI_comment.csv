They want us to be like places in Europe where you can&#39;t defend yourself at all...if they leave us with any guns after the bans they will require that they remain locked up with the ammo separate and only to be taken out when you go to the range.  Might even have to keep them stored at the range.  They will ban pepper spray or tasers too just like the UK.  They want us helpless while the criminals have all the firepower.,Yuibot,2021-03-28T03:40:12Z,0

No. If some fucker points a gun at you.. you shoot them.. if their sister is blaming YOU for shooting her brother... But not the fact that her brother... WAS TRYING TO ROBB THAT PLACE. WITH A GUN... Then she should get a bullet as well. Especialy because of her &quot;He is robbing yall.. Oh well..&quot;... Tht is the most idiotic thing that ANYONE can say... It would be like saying that white people shooting black is just &quot;Oh well&quot;... No.: its fucking retarded. She was basicly DEFENDING... her CRIMINAL Brother... Not even willing to say that he did a bad thing. and sadly got what was going to hapen to him. Nope.. She defended her brother. Its like the idiots of BLM that are now justifying LOOTING... Because &quot;Reparations&quot;... yes.. Untill the places they plan to loot now... Has someone there with a gun... And blowing one looter after another after another.,HarkenRebirth,2020-08-15T00:07:59Z,0

This kind of reminds me of that one situation that was similar. A young man broke into a older woman’s house. The woman shot and killed the man out of fear for her life. As was just said. She didn’t know what was going through the young man’s mind. He could’ve tried to kill her to just that no eye witnesses or whatever. The fear of the unknown to put it best.  But getting back to my story and point. The family and ironically the sister of the young man killed. Said the same thing pretty much. The woman had no right to shoot her brother. Her life was not in danger. Yes her brother broke into her house. But that’s how he makes his money for school clothes. How else is he supposed to make money?    Yes she actually said that word for word.,Curtis Halcomb,2020-06-09T14:18:15Z,0

"I used to bartend in a city biker bar just down the street from &#39;The Projects&#39; and after a few &#39;incidents&#39; I started keeping a .38 in the drawer right under the cash register. I made sure that everybody knew I had it, and sometimes - if some shit was going on - I had a 9mm as well - in open carry. It was OK with the owner and I made sure that he knew that I was fully legal, I practiced at the range and that I knew my rights. In fact, it was him who told me that if someone came around behind the bar and I asked them to leave and they didn&#39;t, then I could legally shoot them dead. The drinking area may be a public space - to a certain degree - so you had to be careful there - but behind the bar is private property. In eight years of working there I was never robbed. The thing is, if you roll over to a robber and give them the till, then that may well not be the end of it. Because you are not just giving them the money, you&#39;re giving them control - not only over your life, but over all the other people in the vicinity too. And you do not want to merely wound them either, because you know what they&#39;ll be thinking about all the time they&#39;re in jail? Getting you back - that&#39;s what. You&#39;ll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. Two in the chest and one in the head - goodnight motherfucker - now you&#39;re dead!",Sal Paradise,2020-05-22T19:12:31Z,0

"Of course the criminal community does not want people to carry a gun.  <br /><br />They can commit crimes at will, gamble on police response times, and if caught, be released on a personal recognizance no cash bond before plea bargaining down to a lesser offense and get early release due to prison overcrowding.  <br /><br />Business owners or the public with legally owned and possessed firearms ruins the criminal enterprises business model.",Raptor Shooting Systems,2019-11-27T17:49:34Z,0
I can sum up the entire problem of the United States right now in two words: PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. each and every human being on this planet is responsible for every word they speak every move they make every action they take and every reaction they have. You whip out a gun to rob somebody you get your ass shot that&#39;s how it works!!! You can always tell folks who ain&#39;t been raised right. It never has anything to do with color it has everything to do with the way they think. I&#39;m sorry their loved one is dead but maybe he shouldn&#39;t have whipped out a gun and tried to rob somebody. In this state where I live you set foot in my house with intent to do harm with any weapon I can blow your damn head off and I would sleep like a baby that night knowing I protected my home my pets my stuff and my family. How&#39;s he supposed to call the police when he&#39;s got a gun in his face? this is what&#39;s wrong with human beings nobody takes responsibility for what they say and what they do,Sacred Serpents®™,2019-11-26T08:49:54Z,0

"This kind of shit is why every employee working for every employer needs to carry a gun. I can tell you that this would end most, if not all, store robberies and force these ghetto thugs to actually go out there and get a job. The fallacy that liberals continue to spread that fewer guns on the streets are a good thing does not deter thugs from committing crimes in the first place. Every American, who passes a mental health evaluation, should be issued a gun by the federal government. This would deter crime and eliminate the need for gun control laws. Just give everyone a handgun with smart technology keyed to that person&#39;s DNA signature. Nobody would need automatic weapons. Oh, and one thing gun control fanatics don&#39;t realize is that police handguns are automatic weapons. ANY gun that automatically loads a round into the chamber is CONSIDERED an automatic weapon.",entertainment-knone,2019-11-24T13:25:41Z,0

"Interesting truth. In the town in Ohio that I grew up in, there are no black people as it is a town full of white German Catholics, and there has not been a single murder committed by any person from the town, nor has there been any store robbery or burglaries by any person living in town or outside of the town.<br /><br />There were two murders of people who lived there, but those were committed by people who came from another town. In fact, in these towns of Ft. Recovery, Coldwater, St. Henry, Greenville, Eaton, Ohio and Portland, Redkey, Bryant, Berne, Geneva, Indiana...the death rates are all car accidents.<br /><br />I have never heard of any store robberies, home burglaries, murders or assaults from people who are from  these towns. Celina is another story.<br /><br />So what is going on in those towns that has no violence, no killing, no stabbings, no shootings other than what comes from out of town? A girl in Coldwater was killed by a black man from another town. This area is so non-violent that the worst crimes are people&#39;s houses being toilet papered. <br /><br />I wonder if liberals ever sat and thought &quot;Gee, why are blue cities full of crime, homelessness, violence, murders, drug trafficking and prostitution, but in the red cities, there is very little of that?&quot; Yeah, Trump is to blame for the violence in the blue cities.....",moorek1967,2019-11-10T02:38:27Z,0

I’ve had conversations with several different people saying they support black lives matter, but when I bring up other black lives that have been affected by the rioting or black on black crimes, they just blow it off and say,  “ but you’re missing the point,” or “ if you’re only focused on that then you’re missing the entire picture,” which doesn’t make sense, because isn’t the idea of black lives matter to help fight racism and police brutality against black people?

So she thinks it&#39;s cool for her dumbass brother to be able to run up to someone put a gun in their face Rob and possibly kill the guy. But it&#39;s a whole different story when someone does the same shit minus the robbery cuz you know the clerk is actually working and contributing to society unlike her dumbass brother who would rather rob a dollar general at gunpoint and probably others then make an honest days pay. See what being a wannabe gangster gets you, six feet under.

Growing I learnt if you a gun gets pulled on you their is a 50-50 chance you will get shot. Once a gun gets drawn on you the AVERAGE human mind goes into fight or flight. The family members must not have been robbed at gun point before if not they wouldn&#39;t be surprised by the why the clerk shot their brother.,BuffteethrBlog,2019-10-31T14:38:18Z,0

Shit here in Detroit it can take  4 or 5 hours same goes an ambulance can take 3-5 hours most people have other people take them to hospital because they know they will die waiting for either to show up that&#39;s why so many people die here because if you get shot and no one to drive you to the hospital right there your going to do because it&#39;s not a joke. It really does take any form of emergency services 3-5 hours to show up or longer it&#39;s places like this where our clerks should all be given a gun on hiring in Detroit and a few city&#39;s a bit to close to it.

yeah that is true there is a stereotype most Americans think black people don&#39;t care about right and wrong and what&#39;s legal. and what&#39;s even more frightening than that is so many white people now are trying to copy black people.

Well if the guy would have walked in with his hand in his pocket and said give me your money I&#39;ve got a gun   then I would you just gave him the money. But when someone&#39;s pointing a gun at you it takes a tenth of a second for them to kill youso just out of fear you&#39;re going to try to defend yourself from someone pointing a gun at your head.  There&#39;s been at least 12 clerks who&#39;s been murdered after they gave the money to the robber lately. if you&#39;re going to rob someplace just come in with your hand in your pocket either they&#39;re going to give you the money or they&#39;re going to laugh at you until you get out of the store they&#39;re probably not going to shoot you.,John Spurlock,2019-10-30T17:28:48Z,0

The sisters reaction isn&#39;t surprising just another example of how being a criminal thug is a mentality that&#39;s passed down.

Im saying this because i know first hand what its like to have a brother like this. I know one thing. I never once defended him. If he was wrong i took sides with the victims. He hated me for it. But i had to. I was never a bad person. I have a huge heart and if i did the things he was doin, i couldnt live with myself. This dudes brother and sister dont care at all.

"The family just went out of their way to prove to the world, live and on camera, that they are trash.   No, you stupid &quot;C&quot; rhymes with punt, that man, who was on the clock trying to earn a living, had every right to defend himself with deadly force.   It&#39;s been proven that not only can a 3 year old pull a trigger, but a 4 year old has done so with intent... more than once.   Here in Ohio, where this happened, last I was aware, 3 precursors must be met to legally utilize deadly force: intent, opportunity, capability.   Most able-bodied humans over the age of 3 have the capability, proximity equates to opportunity,  the second he pulled the weapon his intent was established.   Folks don&#39;t point guns at others unless they intend to pull the trigger; that&#39;s not debatable, that my perception and mindset as the intended victim, thus granting me the legal right to defend myself utilizing deadly force.   And, yes... as others have pointed out, notice this isn&#39;t being reported by the mainstream media, doesn&#39;t fit their narrative... no white folks and no Cops to blame; as has been with literally hundreds of incidents over the past couple years which haven&#39;t made the evening news.

I know this isn&#39;t really the place for a serious discussion on the topic...but I&#39;m going to drop this here anyway. This is what happens when teachers and principals &quot;feel sorry&quot; for a kid and let them get away with zero consequences in public schools. You are reinforcing what is wrong at home. As kids these adult thugs were neglected at home by druggy whore mothers who didn&#39;t give two shits about creating a structure and rules and expectations around these kids. They go to school...where there is structure and rules and expectations....and every time they act like the self serving little assholes they have to be at home because of neglect...the teachers &quot;felt bad&quot; and they got away with it. They&#39;re trained to act like this their whole lives. Instead of paying mothers to produce neglected children...we should be taking children from neglectful mothers having babies they can&#39;t afford. Boys and girls schools may have been cold and harsh and unloving...but damned if they weren&#39;t structured and had expectations. It&#39;s time to bring back the orphanages and boys and girls homes.

So he defended himself. Giving criminals a pass and calling the cops isn&#39;t solving the problem.

he was clearly a menace to society.... it was sad to hear the guy say  reality didnt kick in yet that his brother is dead.  the sister was ignorant AF!  smh...  yea she thinks the employee wasnt supposed to bring a gun for protection to his job.  but its ok for the robber to point a gun at innocent people and demand their money?  come on how stupid does that sound!  maybe if EVERYONE had a gun on them there wont be any more robberies.  because robbing someone would be a suicide mission.,piffdaddy420,2019-10-18T06:35:26Z,0

The police are a reactionary force.  Most situations by the time they show up whatever was going to happen has happened.  They cannot protect you.  What they excel in is speeding tickets and putting away dangerous jaywalkers.  Then factor in all of the cops that get that dear in the headlights look every time a mouse runs by and they just start shooting solidifies it for me.

@Tom Costin best comment I have read today. Straight to the point rather efficiently AND with passion. Well played Tom. (thx for the laugh as well I might add),Tatur Rick,2020-07-24T09:21:12Z,0

You&#39;re not allowed to defend yourself just lay down and give him all your stuff take off your clothes let him do you<br />    you know,David Henneberg,2019-10-18T01:24:04Z,202
"John Doyle has a great video where he describes a situation where an armed robber tried to rob his mother and her friend; there&#39;s security video and the news interviews with people on the street, and he does a great job with pointing out how the people being interviewed said things like &quot;he must have been desperate&quot;, &quot;he must have really needed the money&quot;, &quot;I&#39;d probably just give it to him if he needs it that badly&quot;, etc.<br /><br />This kind of spin, making criminals the victims because &quot;society&quot;, &quot;capitalism&quot;, &quot;socioeconomic whatever&quot; was rampant in communist nations.<br />The robber/murderer did whatever they did because the cruelty of society, the unfairness of capitalism, because of oppression, etc and not just because they were shitheels who thought they had the right to take someone else&#39;s property.",ScottCantDance,2019-10-18T02:13:44Z,19

Exactly the distorted mentality out there.,rocky,2019-10-18T01:23:59Z,349
"@Justin Last That is unfortunate. But, we have the same distorted people out here. I ride our Trolley system to work. I obey the rules and use headphones for my cell. When I can hear people blasting their blue tooth over my headphones, I get upset. I&#39;ve called people out. They think they have the right to do whatever the hell they want and we who follow the rules just have to &quot;oh well, accept it&quot;  F that. I pick my battles cause I don&#39;t want to end up in jail after a fight, but I get tired of it.",rocky,2019-10-18T02:13:52Z,0
