"Interesting that you put this content out there. The idea that some goverments put bureaucracy and obstacles for people to travel feels to me like an abuse on the part of the governments. The right to move freely, and to make a living wherever anyone is, is a personal basic right. Yet governments ban this all over. It&#39;s an abuse to lock a place and tell an individual you cannot enter. Earth belongs to everyone. Of course it is hard when someone has ill intentions, but for this we need to address the issue differently, instead of banning all population from a specific country to travel. Specially when policies are made with all sort of personal interests and where a country can be banned just because another country has specific interests in the resources of said country, or just wants to discredit said country.<br /><br />&quot;Powerful&quot; countries stay powerful in the same way that rich people stay rich. They create systems that allow them to keep those positions, no matter what. They win, the rest lose. By doing this they keep the gap with the other countries wide. There&#39;s inequality. And there&#39;s usually no desire to close that gap. Inspite of the diplomacy saying the opposite. Those are usually false words like those of the politicians and corporate owners that have ambitious goals to reduce climate change.<br /><br />Hundreds of years ago people from european countries (French, German, Portuguese, Spaniards, edit: just realized I forgot to add English) travelled the world. Went almost everywhere, &quot;conquering&quot; other countries. They got there, wiped out populations, cultures, believes, languages. They brought with them diseases that killed hundreds of indigenous peoples. Yet these very same countries ban the entry now to the population from those countries they invaded so many years ago. Countries they extracted their resources, richeness, treasures, even people. Countries they left with such deep wounds. And as far as I know they haven&#39;t even been repaid or at least apologized for. Rarely even acknowledged. <br /><br /><br />So this idea of banning people from traveling, feels like such a ... hipocrisy when looking at their own past, such lack of acknowledging the world belongs to all beings, to respect, to own in the sense of taking care of them. And what we need to heal is the fear, the disconnection, the anger, the pain. Not to break the natural bonds that are created when people travel.",anmahek,2021-04-23T23:46:54Z,0

"I am a European, some people are really judgmental based on looking, I had a terrible experience before I first time went to USA and it was  first time I every traveled on a plane and traveled that far alone. So I have similar hair and eyes color like Eva, maybe a little bit darker, and my skin is darker too. So one of our friend he said to me: &#39;&#39;hmm you have dark brown hair and dark brown eyes and your skin is darker then most of the Europeans, they never let you in to USA, because you look like a terrorist.&#39;&#39; I felt so offended, that time I wasn&#39;t have many friend outside my country, but I had an open heart and never judged anyone based in looking, now I have many friend around the world and I feel more offended from this sentence.  Even I have many privilege to travel and not be labeled like this, which many of my friend doesn&#39;t have, that&#39;s why I feel more angry about this sentence. <br />Note: This friend never was anywhere except 1-2 European countries , let&#39;s called the &#39;&#39;better ones.&#39;&#39; and continuously  judging anyone based on where the person from, without able to talk or know him/her better, actually he isn&#39;t a  friend anymore.<br />Note 2: I don&#39;t want to hurt or offend anyone with my comment, please don&#39;t take this way.

"Couldn&#39;t expect that someone would ever address this topic. I remember my dear friend from Morocco and me laughing bitterly at our, as he called them then, &quot;weak&quot; passports and I thought he had figured it out by himself. I&#39;m a Belarusian now living in Italy struggling every year for a stay permission. I came for studying and I&#39;m very grateful I could use this opportunity. I remember when my classmates would go on Erasmus and were asking me why I wasn&#39;t. I just new I would have many problems getting another visa for Erasmus for 6 or 12 months in France, let&#39;s say. Being a student alone counting only on myself I couldn&#39;t permit myself such a luxury. Still, I understand how privileged I am in comparison to other Belarusians who would love to go abroad, travel and maybe live in another country for a little of that experience. I would love to travel many countries, unfortunately for now I just struggle surviving from one month to another. Still I have a deep believe that I am on the right road and I have no hurry. I enjoy every day of my life looking around, seeing those stunning sunsets over the mountains... I realise how happy I&#39;m and if I die tmrrw I won&#39;t have regrets of seeing many places. In the end, it&#39;s not exactly the goal in life, it&#39;s just a pleasant and beautiful bonus to it. Send love and light to Eva and each single of you reading.

"Eva, I have enjoyed watching dozens of your videos, but have come across a few that are outside your lane, and expose an unexpected view of immaturity. I feel compelled to share feedback - not to complain, but in hopes you&#39;ll consider perspective beyond your years and experiences. <br />First, let&#39;s agree that travel is a privelege for any and all who are able to achieve it. A small portion of your audience are your peers in their  travel experiences, but the majority of your viewership are nowhere near your status in terms of travels or ability to have such travels. To lecture your audience, a majority of whom are not travelers, about the privelege you have (that many of us do not have) smacks of arrogance and entitlement.

My suggestion is to have a global travel visa that all countries allow entry for  travel for tourism purposes for 12 months with no stay in any one country to exceed 3 months. So anyone gets a chance to travel if they can prove they are genuine travelers but only one visa and one interview and one fee. They should submit travel pictures and maybe online training to get this visa  so at least they can travel for one year hassle free.

"This explanation is really oversimplified... As a matter of fact, there is generally no such thing as visa-free entry for foreign citizens, there&#39;s usually only visa-free entry for a very short time period and with lots of other restrictions. You will usually need a visa if you need more than that. Even with this reservation in mind, what&#39;s counted as visa-free access in the tables such as shown in this video can in fact be an electronic visa based entry, e.g. in order to enter Australia or the US you need to fill out an electronic application, pay a fee and wait for travel authorization, sometimes you will be required to pass an interview. On the other hand, once you get a mutiple entry Schengen visa, you don&#39;t need to get individual visas to enter ~30 countries including Schengen members and non-Schengen members which allow entry with a Schengen visa.<br /><br />I suggest that you recalculate your table assuming that for visa related purposes all Schengen members are a single entity and &quot;visa-free access&quot; with obligatory travel authorization is more like visa on arrival than real &quot;visa-free&quot;.",Panda,2020-07-08T00:03:25Z,1

"Thank you for this one. You know, it is amazing how disparate the ability to travel freely is around the world. For instance, your Polish passport has WAY more of an ability to enter a country visa-free/visa on arrival than my US passport! Ranked 84 to your 114! For instance, Iran, a country with some of the most beautiful heritage sites, I have to apply for a visa and you get a free one. Life without borders. That has always been my dream to be able to one day travel without border restrictions. And even though I have been to some beautiful places, staying long term in some of them is extremely difficult. Travel should be a right, not just a privilege. But it is what it is as we are at the mercy of our government and their policies. I have searched for a better passport to travel on and ways to become a citizen of those countries but the requirements are truly daunting.",On a Walkabout,2020-07-07T08:29:07Z,0

Boarders and boundaries were drawn by man to keep man separated so the Gold Oil Dollars = GOD can enjoy all the privileges fully making the human species be blamed for their wrong doing their faults their weaknesses. Human being means that you are a conscious and you are capable of BE that means a human being means immense possibilities child born is a genius only to be made in to a aberrant creature by extruding through a system call education schooling and university. <br />Anyway we drew artificial lines on earth then we did not even have enough knowledge about surveying knowledge some how British commonwealth together provided separate land divisions then we provided democracy in 1948 to the world Poland did not have freedom or privilege until entered Western Europe. Thanks to the British commonwealth plus Americans freeing up so call Eastern Europe.

"Governments of EU countries have to negotiate freedom of travel on their own. So what is your point? For example, the EU didn&#39;t help Poland to get visa-free travel to the USA recently. Of course, economic freedom of the EU single market helped Poland to get richer - that is the reason that your passport index is going up - more countries want to share your economical success by allowing your business people to travel freely. But I know that getting a visa to some countries for Polish people is easier because of their past, not EU. For example, visa to Belarus is very cheap for Polish citizens, I never heard of Polish citizen not getting a visa to North Korea(Poland still have an embassy with them). It is still easier to travel with a Polish passport to the United Arab Emirates than with for example an Irish passport(Ireland is in the EU and Irish citizen need a visa on arrival to the UAE) thanks to the Polish government, not EU.",robertoszczecin,2020-02-16T15:51:28Z,14

Don’t be fooled by this nonsense guys. The power of a passport is not just the number of visa free countries you can enter. It’s also the power of ur country to get u out of a tough situation if need be. I can hardly see Poland despatch a military aircraft to repatriate its citizens. Recent example Corona virus repatriation.,STEVE BHANTOOA,2020-02-10T03:19:51Z,30
"Well, the coronavirus is not exactly the best example - Polish citizens, as they are EU citizens as well, have been safely evacuated back to Europe by the French. Under certain conditions, EU citizens are entitled to seek help from any EU member state embassy, they&#39;re not strictly limited to their own country. And as shown by the coronavirus example, EU member states will likely cooperate in cases of international emergencies. So yeah, while Poland may not be exactly the most powerful country in the EU, at least as long as it keeps being a member, its passport will be pretty strong for all travel-related purposes.<br /><br />There are legitimately different ways to measure passport power, but they mostly matter for people who treat citizenships as a business. Look up e.g. the Nomad Capitalist channel - if you&#39;re just a regular middle class person, that stuff might be shocking.",kFY,2020-02-12T00:59:35Z,15

"&quot;Privilege&quot; is a really politically loaded term.  Careful with that.

"@VariableVision <br /><br />I know what you are talking about, i traveled in some pretty rough areas in latin america(for example El Salvador and Honduras) and also in northern africa, however the reality is, that people are bad mostly not because of their culture(except for discrimination) and definently not because of their ethnicity, they are bad because of circumstances in their lives.<br />Honduras for example struggels with some of the highest homicide rates in the world due to imense gang violence (similar in el salvador), these are developments of the last decades though and stem from people who immigrated illigaly into the USA(either because of economic struggle or war), became criminals due to us politics and then got deported by the us gov. back to Honduras, resulting in expansions of the gang/cartel powers into a structurally weak country and basically taking over the country as a route for narco.trafficing.<br /><br /><br />All of this would not have happend <br /><br />1. if the USA would not perpetually try to colonize latin america<br />2. The stupid war on drugs would be ended <br /><br />3. There would be no boarders for Humans/no illigal immigration <br /><br />4.

"Here is my travel history. First of all I have a Lebanese travel document for Palestinian refugees, meaning I cannot travel anywhere outside Lebanon without getting a visa.<br />However I traveled to some places in the world.<br />- United Arab Emirates (Where I grew up)<br />- Oman (United Arab Emirates residents get visa on arrival for Oman. It was a 5 day trip to Muscat)<br />- Jordan (Mother&#39;s side of the family apply visas for me used to be a hassle but now it is easier. I used to travel yearly to visit extended family)<br />-  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (The northern occupied part of Cyprus, the only way I could enter there was because I applied to a university and paid the tuition fee. The acceptance letter was considered a visa for them)<br />- Turkey (Had to apply for a visa, they love Palestinians so I guess that&#39;s a thing that helped, traveled to 5 cities in a span of 10 days and really enjoyed it!)<br />- Lebanon<br /><br />If you know any place my travel document can go to please tell me, I would like to visit any place I could go to.<br />As an extra side note; some countries listed may have been harder to travel to if I didn&#39;t have a UAE residence permit",Mohamad Kaddoura,2020-02-01T19:00:33Z,0

There are people out there who are good people like you and I but they will never ever be able to see the Eiffel Tower ever in their lives, even if they worked really hard for it, just because of the discrimination and racism within the passport system.

This world still has the backwardness of the 20th century such as racism and prejudice. However, they are no longer applied to necessities in life; they&#39;re now applied to other systems such as travelling like the one mentioned in the video and background checks in other things than travelling such as job applications, school applications, licensing, etc. We need to address and fight this modern form of Jim Crow racism within the passport system.",Brian,2020-01-23T04:23:24Z,0

"Its far more perverse then its made out to be. Its also a means of maintaining geo-political control....ie i can come to you easily to trade, but you can’t. The math of the flow of currency and trade is quite obvious. <br />A passport is but a mere verification of your identity and crime clearance. <br />The contradiction is that although there is an interlinked world economy and common humanity, this does not translate to freedom of movement and a dubious double standard and poorly defined set of rules exist with regards to travel and trade. <br />At some level you could also view this as an extension of colonial or imperial power which up to this day have not truly changed. <br />If the world is to be truly happy, the world needs to truly be set free...",eti3000,2020-01-18T10:14:00Z,0

I often return to the same country because countries change over time. For example, China in 1981 is radically different than China today.

My passport isn&#39;t privileged.  The world treats me as a criminal by birth. And the funny thing is even people from our own countries like tour operators who organise foreign tours discriminate against us.  When they see that I have only managed to travel to a handful of poor counties make them less interested in serving me. The fact that I&#39;m a professional holding a job at the same place for over a decade and owns property and vehicle and no criminal record means nothing,A moment to think,2020-01-17T13:33:35Z,0

It amazes me when people go to different countries particularly to the pacific islands they only stay at resorts and that’s it they don’t even set foot outside and see the life outside and quality is important even if I have a one day stopover on a flight to England and Australia I still try get out and have a look around.<br />Time is one thing it’s attitude that’s important when you travel because at times it can get interesting and you see something that the media and the government of your country do not tell you the truth of what people are really like in the country you are visiting.<br />Great video 👍👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-01-17T06:49:36Z,3

Your way of travel ‘quality of depth rather than quantity’ is why I love your vlog and  most likely my favourite travel vlogger. It annoys me that so many travellers experience travelling only to count of numbers of countries they’ve visited. They like to self praise themselves to others how many they’ve conquered. Travel is all about the depth of the travel experience rather quantity. When I stumbled upon your video in Syria I knew you’re the traveller that I’ll be interested to follow and watch your contents. Enjoy your travel and keep creating cool videos 👍,mi3rebus,2020-01-16T19:44:07Z,0

"Sadly I hold a Pakistani passport and it&#39;s one of the 4th worst passport in the world. The reason why it&#39;s this weak is because of our people, there intention to always over stay on their visas, settle illegally in developed countries and making false cases to seek asylum in these countries. Unless or until our people stop doing this practice, our passport will never gain its value and we will continue to suffer with these stupid travel restrictions that are imposed on us since long.",AAM NEWS,2020-01-16T19:26:19Z,0

"I use an Indonesian passport and my dream is to become a &quot;visa collecter&quot; hahaha. The story of Baderkhan is really inspiring! I found him on Instagram and I&#39;ve been enjoying his travel stories (and your travel story with him too in Kurdistan mwahaha). Same here, I used to have a goal of traveling to as many countries/places as possible but now I understand the limitation of travels and life itself more, I have redefined my definition of &quot;as many places as possible&quot;. I think it&#39;s important to have a reason why we want to travel to a certain country (say historical, religious and cultural reasons) instead of just traveling there for the sake of traveling. Especially now in the age of social media where travel sometimes has become some sort of bragging rights. Personally I enjoy your vlogs and stories because you really dig deep into the reason why you want to travel. The human interaction, the story telling and so on.

Loved this video. It definitely reinforces the fact that I should never take the power of my British passport for granted. As I live in France I&#39;ve sometimes thought about applying for dual citizenship to get a French passport since it offers some visa-free countries that are not available to me via my UK passport. For instance Russia recently opened up eVisa travel for the city of St Petersburg to allow easy access for many European citizens however I cannot use this new system since the UK was specifically excluded. Which goes to show that even strong passports of neighbouring countries can differ from one another.,Matthew Tasker,2020-01-16T13:24:32Z,3
@Matthew Tasker As far i know all the EU citizens will be able to apply for a Russian visa online as long as you can prove you want to visit St. Petersburg or Moscow,Bart Boruc Comedy,2021-04-02T00:55:42Z,0

Unfortunately, no matter how good you are in a foreign community or how good you contribute to their economy, but if you are coming from a weak passport country, they will always less value you or even give you no value. Nations are busy facilitating opportunities to powerful passports while on other side restricting weak passports as much as they can.

"@aggy ace Unfortunately I need a Russian visa unless if I&#39;m only going to the Far East regions in which I can apply for evisa. I went to Russia (Vladivostok &amp; Irkutsk) the last year and the process was straightforward, go to the embassy submit passport and a voucher from a tourist company listing the places you will visit and the hotels (can be anywhere, can get this online) or do the process through a tourist agency, the visa fee is free if I wait one week.",khinzirallah,2020-01-22T08:38:41Z,0
