Actually the clothes and the singing reminded me of the Toda people in India, who are a very special tribal minority and it is said that they may originate from Arabia.

"Faisal is wearing the traditional yemeni cloths. In fact, much of southern Saudi Arabia was part of Yemen and Yemen is the homeland of all pure arabs. North Yemen is especially a gem and the people there are too nice",Paul Buttersworth,2020-11-22T08:24:43Z,0
"Well studies show that the origin of Arabs are from the levantine desert as Yemen had already a lot of kingdoms which spoke languages like Himyarite, Sabaic and hadramic until the rise of Islam when Arabic replaced all of them. Jazan region was also not part of Yemen but an autonomous tribal entity under the Ottoman Empire + the clothes worn in the video they belong to the tribes of Khawlan only, not all Yemenis dress like this",Waleed,2021-02-07T09:10:01Z,0

مستحيل أن يأتي الكفار إلينا خصيصا للسياحة; لأنّهم يرون الشرق الأوسط منطقة خطرة تراهم احتلال من فوق. لكن هؤلاء  يعملون جنود غالبا أو في الشركات أرامكو مثلا، وفي إجازاتهم يتنزّهون إمّا في حماية الإمارة أو مع صديق من المنطقة. هذا ما عرفته من أحدهم بالصدفة في أمريكا وأنا في الانتظار في مطعم همبرغر، فذكر بأنه يعرف جبال عسير ووو.,د. حنان مرعي آل مرعي عسيريّ Asiri Hanan,2020-09-08T10:24:31Z,1
"أنت تطلق على الآخرين اسم &quot;غير مؤمنين&quot; لأن لديهم رأيًا مختلفًا حول أصل الكون ، والعالم. تتوقع أن يحترمك نفس الأشخاص الذين تسميهم &quot;غير المؤمنين&quot; - برأي مختلف - بينما لا تحترم هؤلاء الأشخاص ، وبالتالي تسميهم &quot;غير المؤمنين&quot;. ولهذا يوجد الكثير من الكراهية في العالم ، وهذا هو سبب الحرب ، أي الدين. قبل إلقاء محاضرة على أشخاص آخرين ، ضع يدك على رأسك وانظر من تحتها.<br /><br />You call other people &quot;unbelievers&quot; because they have a different opinion about the origin of the universe, and of the world. You expect those same people that you call &quot;unbelievers&quot; to respect you — with a different opinion — when you disrespect these people, and therefore call &quot;unbelievers.&quot; And that is why there is so much hatred in the world, and that is the cause of war, namely: religion.

"Hello:<br />If you look at these people customs , You will see a similarity with the people of Hawaii , The  way they welcome  the guest  with <br />flowers around the head and the way the men dressed , Both they wear a skirt . The name Hawaii came from Arabic means <br />the breasy Island . The People of Yemen  like the rest in the Area liked diving and looking for pearls , The word in Arabic for pearls <br />is Lulu . The name of the capital of Hawaii is Honolulu  the  meaning in Arabic Hona  alulu  meaning in that bay area is a very good place<br />to dive and look for Lulu .  I talked to people from Hawaii and asked them about the name , He said we think it came from Samoa , I told him the names  in Arabic has meaning and I explained to him every thing , He said , It make sense , But for me these people to come all the way is  shocking , I said . These people had relatives in Indonesia  .",Ahmad Alhusein,2020-03-02T04:26:48Z,0

There is plenty of it.. Nature is always seducing whether it be entirely desert with just sand all over.. Or rugged mountains that just Rocky... Be it green hills of my Kashmir.. Or the snowy peaks over there... The rivers and streams playing the music.. Or winds in desert... Or the lakes... Or seas..Allah made it beautiful... Soothing to heart and soul...and people and cultures.. Making it easier for us to Glorify his name.. And in return earn peacefull heart..,idrees shah,2020-02-28T23:25:44Z,0

"@moser bear let me give you a lesson in history because it seems to me that you come from a poor and ill-educated background. We aren&#39;t talking about an old civilization that the American people now are detached from. This is contemporary history, we&#39;re still living IN it. These are recent events upon which the current American nation was founded. Native nations are still living with the feeling that they were ripped off. 😉<br /><br />If only poor education and poverty were eliminated we wouldn&#39;t have to live with poor minds like yours. 😀😘",Hishamm Aezat,2020-02-29T14:31:25Z,0

"I used to belong to an unofficial natural history group in the Eastern Province. Every few weeks we&#39;d drive up the Dammam-Riyadh Expressway and sometimes drive 1000km off road in the Dahna and camp. my fave region near Dhahran is Hamra Judah - I camped there a lot. I have hundreds of GPS coords from my travels back in the 90s between the Abandoned village Qaryat As Sufla on the old Tapline Road, the Mastodon Bones in the cave roof near there, Shark tooth Wadi, all sorts of cool exploring info which we need to give back to the Saudis themselves now.",Jeremy Stocks,2020-02-27T20:38:26Z,0

No one has power over what is going on politically and no one is discussing politics here!

"All four of you are living in a time where there is no rush, just people who work and have time to do the things humans were meant to do, relaxing by exploring their immediate surroundings.  Our childhood was similar, going into the nearby spots to splash in a stream in the wilderness with some yummy Indian food packed for lunch, warmed over stones and firewood and drinking water from the clean stream water. Lucky you to be going back in time.  Now we have to go to a park as people themselves are pretty scary. I suppose that is why we have health and safety as we city people do idiotic things and end up  losing our life. Even stopping on a road can be scary, so enjoy the hospitality of your friends.
