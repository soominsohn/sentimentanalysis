"Sorry to sound rude, but I think this is just a stupid thing to do. At least, don&#39;t expect meeting &quot;nice people&quot; all around the world when you (as a girl) walk alone in the wilderness. This should probably be a warning to other people (especially girls) watching these videos. Life isn&#39;t a fairytale.",skiddybipbop,2021-04-24T16:31:49Z,0

"So extraordinary. Thanks again for the videos, Eva.     Seeing how sad you were about departing from that majestic place, I feel for you, I remember having that sad feeling before I knew about the promise God has made concerning the future of the earth. I have a message for you that you really ought to have on your heart, it will forever defeat those depressing and sad thoughts that life is a fleeting and temporary thing, and God Himself is the only one who can make this happen. He promises that the earth and the heavens above shall remain for eternity, after He remakes them when the great day of judgment has passed.   The scripture that foretells this is most certainly true, check it out, ““Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.”<br />‭‭Revelation‬ ‭21:1-6‬ ‭ESV‬‬<br /><a href=""https://www.bible.com/59/rev.21.1-6.esv"">https://www.bible.com/59/rev.21.1-6.esv</a>           So today, I am going to pray that you and all of your loved ones will be blessed to know that this is true and for you to behold it, as the grace that it is. God decided not to reveal it to everyone, but He is revealing it as He wants at the proper time. Those who died righteous, will be raised righteous to the same everlasting goodness that God has in store. We get to explore and enjoy Socotra, and the whole universe, without any pain, sorrow, or evil of any kind, forever and ever. Peace to you",gnarmarmilla,2020-07-27T06:28:51Z,1

Put some honey on the scratch. For bad gashes slap some cayenne pepperinto the cut.You&#39;re the type of women I find attraction too...the ones unafraid and looking great with messy hair. Keep your chin up. Guavas are good but don&#39;t break a tooth on those seeds! I would start planting them everywhere and get some chickens for yourself....soon. You never know how long youll be there.,thomas ackerman,2020-04-04T16:30:32Z,0

"Eva, what a beautiful place!  I&#39;d advise you to stay and focus your thoughts on nature itself and benevolence, but if you do go to comfort and be with your family, the actual virus itself will be the least of your concern.  Trust me, there&#39;s a very specific sinister reason that this is all happening, and how this disproportionate response is affecting and influencing the entire population has become complete insanity.  The entire world will soon be enslaved because of fear and wilful ignorance; so critical and logical, rational thinking will serve you best during these times.  Look at that view from the cave, and your curious mountain friends, I&#39;d stay!  My heart goes out to you friend!",Sky Dance,2020-04-04T16:00:49Z,6

"@Daler Mehndi In one interview Eva compared herself to David Attenborough like she can also be traveller like him. So I guess she must be completely full of herself.  I have feeling that she is even trying to copy his style of narration but unfortunately,  she will never going to be in his league. Don&#39;t get me wrong. At the beginning I was really inspired by Eva&#39;s content but after time I realised that the way she acts .... feels just soo fake and annoying at times. Polish-smart women in her 30s acts like teenage dummy .  I don&#39;t buy this. But hey ... fake smiles, silly faces and fake injuries sell better I guess.....",Destiny Blue,2020-09-29T02:09:20Z,0
