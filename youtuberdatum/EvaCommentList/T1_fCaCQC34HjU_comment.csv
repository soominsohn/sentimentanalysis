"I love watching your videos!  My name is Ben Novick, and I&#39;m the local private investigator on the Big Island of Hawaii.  We have all of the climates of the world and since the pandemic have experienced an interesting time surviving without many tourists, but it&#39;s extra beautiful. Here, we have little to no crime as we use to experience in Los Angeles where I came from 22 years ago.  The island is 184 miles around, with 170K people, two volcanoes and 5 Covid cases last week. Here, my jobs have mainly been security for entertainment people who  come here to escape civilization. A couple of stalkers have even tried to purse people here, but were unsuccessful.  I have friends who are dogs, mongooses, a drake (male) Perin duck named &quot;Donald&quot; and a black Astrolarp hen named &quot;sparkle.&quot;     She lays me one big brown egg each morning, leaving it on a chair outside my front door.  <br />We are totally self sufficient.  While I don&#39;t often eat red meat, we have cows, goats, sheep and a mass of wild boar and all the fish you could desire. <br />If you like mangoes, strawberry papayas, and coconuts you may eat them to your heart&#39;s desire in addition to many other varieties of tropical fruit, including Suriname cherries.  All vegetables grow here but carrots and potatoes need to be grown in a soil garden because much of the ground is lava rock.  My latest job has been taking  a few locals on UFO tours.  Since the pandemic we have been seeing lots of them, and I had one startling experience when I pointed a flashlight at one and it came to us--scared my guests to the point when I looked around they were gone.  But, I sense they mean us no harm.    If ever here, feel free to look me up!  Favorite spots are the black sand beach, Akaka falls, rain forest, an observatory, the volcanoes park and caves.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful explorations!   Have a good evening.",Ben Novick,2021-04-25T08:02:33Z,0

@Icy Girl yes usually from northern somalia because massive ships come and ransack the sea from immesaurable amount of fish. so some  locals armed up an ofcourse try to hold the ships for ransom. think spain robbed like billions $ worth of fish around that area,Luqman,2021-03-14T01:45:43Z,5

"There is a kind of arrogance-<del>-perhaps that is too strong--</del> but maybe a sort of foolishness that comes with the triple gifts of wealth, youth and appearance that is deeply but subtly rotten. The ego is too big, manner too confident and  behavior too exhibitionistic to be authentic. She seems like a kind but quite naïve young woman who assumes that her life is a stage performance and other people are mostly props. She is &quot;here&quot; to impress us with her privileges and moves through the world in carefully measured performances.  Aging will involve painful losses and  important lessons and one day perhaps, this actress might look inward and grow.",DoctorGarkle,2020-11-30T21:34:48Z,0

"Not sure how this was recommended but it was great. It brought me so many memories. My dad was a sailor for 20 years at a cargo company, I got to travel to Japan when I was 6 and to Europe when I was 13 in a cargo ship, it was a great experience. Loved seeing the rooms, looked just like the ones in the cargo ships my dad worked at. Great Job!",David Angel,2020-09-01T12:22:14Z,41

"14 days on a ship during quarantine. ...hahahahahahaha, there are still people on board who are trapped on vessels, because despite most ports are open with regulations, many shipowners don&#39;t want to comply. They prefer to keep the same crew rather than to postpone the operation of the vessel for a few days and to pay more to agents and plane tickets. ...as a result there are seafarers who are on board for more than a year, maybe 1 and a half.",Iakwvos Birdakas,2020-08-31T22:33:37Z,0

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”<br /><br />Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.<br /><br />But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”<br /><br /><br /><br />And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.",Bebe o,2020-08-07T20:21:15Z,0

You have not seen big boats. I worked for Hyundai in Busan south Korea...Half the city of Busan is the car plant. I took a bus to work from my Hyundai apartment to my office and both were in the company compound i.e. both bus stops were within the compound O_o!. (basically half the city is owned by Hyundai and is part of the compound). Out my office window was a Mega car park up to the horizon of cars waiting to be shipped around the world all the way to the port and at the port were these Goliath ships like mini cites on water that would dwarf the average skyscraper in just height alone.,ojbeez,2020-08-03T19:07:36Z,0

In general, fossil fuels are responsible for roughly 60% and the agriculture industry is actually responsible for around 15% (I’m sorry, I don’t know where you got your figures from, but they’re false) All of these things have a huge impact on the environment and in this day and age we should make aware of the choices we make and how they affect the planet.",Daniel Say,2020-07-23T14:37:19Z,0

"Big difference living and working on one for months on end. Sooner or later steak and lobster every Friday on Diego Garcia on board my ship wasn&#39;t enough from keeping me from going on island. It can honestly feel like prison after a while no matter how nice it is. You get institutionalized and you have to do things to keep your mind out of being confined. Gym, watch movies, play basketball, play Nintendo, build things. Have to have a regimeted schedule. Make your bed, clean your bathroom, have discipline. People can flip out there.

"You do know that you sailed right through the so called high risk area? I passed there a few weeks ago on another cargo ship and we took plenty measures against pirates. On your ship I did not even see barbed wire... Quite risky, I&#39;d say!",F. Jakob Schmidt,2020-07-08T09:52:11Z,0
"Cargo boats don&#39;t go full speed when loaded in the middle of the ocean, they need to save fuel and they have a date to arrive so its not necessary to go full speed, also costs more",Leonieke Fontijn,2020-07-08T09:21:42Z,0
"We were a slow moving ship, maximum speed 14-16 knots. Not like a frigate. Carried ammo, explosives, military vehicles. RO RO ships. Maritime Preposition Ships.  30 days to cross Pacific. Jacksonville Florida to Guam. 30 days Moorhead City NC to Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Sounds like about the same speed this boat was cruising in nice calm waters. Piece of cake. If you do the math, 14 knots in 24 hours you&#39;ve covered lots of ocean. No traffic lights, no stopping for rest or refueling. Going around the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, it&#39;s allot of ocean. 7 days good timing.",Amphib Aav,2020-07-11T05:28:03Z,0

"This is a nicely done video. Thank you. But I must also add that your experience, while a bit unique having been on a boat, is, well, rather ordinary given the times. People around the world have been isolated, quarantined and displaced from their normal lives and routines. I guess watching what was a compelling experience for you personally seemed dull and ordinary for me. I&#39;m stranded in Thailand where I was stuck in a small apartment for 3 months communicating with folks around the world doing similar stuff.  There was little unique or interesting in your story, other than the boat angle. And slow ocean going freighters, as you discovered, are pretty boring as well.",Travels with Charlie Hub,2020-07-07T08:07:24Z,0

I spent 4 days on a cargo ship from Bali to Flores Island because there were multiple smaller boats taking the journey that had sunk in the weeks before due to being over capacity. We were told it would only be a 2 day trip but it ended up being much longer. I wish our accommodations had been like yours haha We slept in the belly of the ship on wood boards surrounded by hundreds of people (and insects) packed in like sardines with no ventilation and lots of smokers.

We were in Port Canaveral, Port of Miami, Cococay.... and finally, Barbados port. Could not go out, we were only getting supplied with food and then just see the land from far in the boat ;( at least we were safe and had food :) <br />3 long months till finally middle of June, it was my turn to finally go home. <br />Crazy and long process to get back. once in my country, got tested (negative), still went thru quarantine and just now July 2nd I&#39;m allowed to leave my quarantine. Thanks bento God. Finally home and praying things get better soon, so we can get back to normal. ;)",D GonzCons,2020-07-04T00:41:04Z,151

"Yep, that is Jolly Quarzo - a 240m long ship from Messina Line Company. By the way, her ship is Ad Astra (70m long) so she overestimated the size. In reality, all deep water vessels look huge when compared to what people normally see on land. At open sea, you cannot easily compare it to anything around you so people tend to disorientate and delude themselves about sizes and distances. They always assume ship/land is closer and bigger than it really is. For example, 1 nautical mile (1.852km) really looks like 100m when at sea.",Simon R.,2020-07-07T09:21:32Z,1

@AirwaveMustang ya cool thanks for that. I see now. Interesting. Didn&#39;t know they made them anymore. The only sea going Landing Craft ships I thought existed were the Tank Landing Ships. I&#39;m guessing she rode Socotra 2. Seems to do that run to Dubai- Socotra. Something interesting about a Landing Craft is they must be a flat bottom boat to be able to beach it and ride shallow water. A Tank Landing Ship or LST military used you could  flood ballast tanks for deap ocean travel and pump water out for shallow water and beaching. It would be interesting to see if these do that. And yes its the Ad Astra vessel according to ship registration not Socorta 2,Amphib Aav,2020-07-13T20:27:26Z,1
"@Nicolas Denis I was just checking out the SOCOTRA 2 vessel on line. To my surprise, it is listed as a Landing Craft. ( I could be wrong but I believe this is vessel she took)  Well, I&#39;d be curious to see if that bow lowers like a ramp thus giving characteristics of a Landing Craft for roll on roll off gear. I was thinking more about the military Landing crafts, so in the end, you were right. Seems like a Landing Craft with container hauler characteristics. I thought with all the containers on board was just a container hauler. I get the security thing and all that but would have liked a more detailed description of the vessel. There ya go. Ok I just viewed video again and she is standing in front of ship registration number and yes. IMO 9628556 as mentioned in a posting here. Ad Astra. Not Socorta 2. Landing Craft. Very good.",Amphib Aav,2020-07-13T20:26:02Z,1

Saudia and UAE is bombing yemen and the children and stealing everything from the island unfortunately the cargo ship u were in was loaded with stolen things from the island to UAE ... that’s sad hopefully when u get back to ur country u might have freedom of speech and share something about the islands ... that will mean a lot to us Yemenis and everyone that might help yemen and kick the sauidas and uae",knightraider,2020-07-01T02:15:18Z,0

It’s also pretty good that the UAE gave you all tests before letting you in, they’re taking great care of their people and not taking risks. So pleased you got back safely and no cyclone issues!

"You have spent 80 days in Socatra island and enjoyed everything , you posted a lot of videos from there , people were very very generous and kind to you , haven’t said that in those 80 days you never mentioned anything whatsoever about those poor people struggle and deliver a message behalf of them to what kind of unseen occupation the are under from the UAE 🇦🇪. You never bothered to share some light to the real conflict over there and try to help such an innocent and lovely people. You were only taking and taking and taking during all of the journey and you didn’t give anything back . I don’t know why you really left but few days ago the island has fallen into UAE and no coincidence the people who ported you out were the same people. I believe you should’ve said something and not be scared like the rest of the cowards in this world.",Ali Yemini,2020-06-29T01:43:34Z,0

A chapter closes and another begins an amazing journey you had there. As for the life at sea as you found out the days pretty much blend into one  and you were lucky that you didn’t get hit by the cyclone at sea. I was in a massive storm that hit our 74ft yacht somewhere between Tonga and New Zealand which went the whole night and things got very lively that night but the next morning it was dead calm with not a breath of wind and it stayed like that for the next three days. As your Captain said it’s the nature of the sea very unpredictable.👍👍👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-06-28T23:09:52Z,1

I can&#39;t believe you spent three months on an island due to the coronavirus.   Then 6 days on the cargo ship and 14 days in quarantine.  Now in Adu Dhabi Emirates.    You must be literally dying to get back to England UK.   I guess you will have a lot to tell about your journeys around the world.

Iran also has the longest coastline with the Gulf...Historically speaking 5000 years of history the Persians dominated that Gulf. Also, the Persian Gulf has always been the lifeline for the Persian empires of old. The Arabs have access to the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea. Today, the whole world is afraid of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz/Persian Gulf. Not Saudi Arabia or UAE!",Khaled S,2020-06-28T19:42:09Z,0

You were very fortunate. Any place else you be stuck in isolation the  UAE is a rich country and the king is paying for the test. In the beginning it was 3 thousand a test. Now it&#39;s still 200 buck a test. Majority country even the top country can&#39;t not afford to test everbody. So they just put them in isolation for 16 days to a month. Yep crazy year. Made everyone think about what important. Not surprising home refurbished &amp; hardware  store are doing fantastically. Home as to be custom fit perfect  now. Clothes no so. Empty stores.

"@ROCK BOTTOM ya, go down to the central Philippines to Camarines Sur and get to Malandog island. Just getting there is nuts!

At night you&#39;re traveling on the water with only a flashlight. Got the Hershey squirts, sun baked like a lobster. Everything is wet from the ocean or your sweat. No toilets to speak of. Forget toilet paper. Thank God for a portable vidette.  That ain&#39;t a vacation. That&#39;s an insane adventure.  And drag along 6 people and an old lady with you looking for relatives she hadn&#39;t seen in 60 years. Then get to Naga City, take plane to Clark field and face 3 hours of Manila traffic with a pissed of taxi driver and I don&#39;t blame him.
