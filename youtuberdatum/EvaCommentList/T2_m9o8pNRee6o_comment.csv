What’s your heart guiding you to? Going off-grid and starting a homestead takes tremendous skill and a lot of work. There’s a lot of preparation involved if you want to set it up right and with dependency. I hope to do it myself in the next 18 months. As long as you’re ready to go into it humbly then it’ll be great.,Stefan Burns,2021-04-28T04:04:50Z,0

It&#39;s been almost a year now since we first heard of the Corona Virus found in a vet market in Wuhan. And we thought the world was going to stop. It didn&#39;t stop at all. But it changed. And in a very negative way. Thank you for reminding me Eva how positive we used to be before the pandemic and I promise you all that I&#39;m gonna try to be less negative from today.,Mustafa Ali,2021-03-26T18:51:14Z,0
"Ya know, after years of travel and living in foreign countries, sometimes I wonder how my life would have been if I hadn&#39;t traveled. What if I had bought that little piece of land off grid and built that small little homestead by hand? What if I had joined a commune as I had always wanted to do? Well, here I am an American, 71 years old, half crippled and living on the tourist island of Koh Samui, Thailand (with the Thai) and I&#39;m looking at the next place that I want to go. And, I tell you what, I always measure my life with this one question. If you have to jump into the box (coffin) right now, would you have any regrets. If the answer can always be an emphatic &quot;NO&quot;, then you are absolutely on your life path. The house, the dog, and the horse. If it is for you, it will happen!  But as long as the road pulls you, then that&#39;s where you belong. But hey, that&#39;s just an old traveler&#39;s opinion.",Norman Brown,2021-03-25T14:26:56Z,7

(Just find a good dog sitter.)<br />My philosophy is: CONTRAST often makes people the happiest, like coming home from a long trip, resting after climbing a mountain, a holiday after a stressful project, etc.<br />Many of us are not &quot;made&quot; for being happy with our situation all the time. So let&#39;s change the situation time again and again!<br />Thank you for being so open about your thoughts and feelings in this video. A.C.",Aglaia Cassata,2021-03-23T16:24:16Z,1

"All of your videos are a great inspiration. I&#39;ve always considered myself to be a really great guy, but like you, I&#39;m always looking for self improvement such as kindness, because I think the world needs that. Is it covid-19 as you say? I really don&#39;t know, but people are getting Ruder and selfish. Escalate rather than deescalate. As far as advice. I would say give yourself 3 months to relax and get in touch with yourself, so you don&#39;t burn out. And when you return to making videos and traveling, do it with a newfound sense of pride and a slower pace so that you can enjoy it more. I think the finished product will be better and you&#39;ll be happier doing it. As far as finding a cute Cottage somewhere to call your home. If I was you, I would retrace my steps, because there are many people you have stayed with that would probably have one for you, just for the asking. Take care I&#39;ve enjoyed all of your videos.",Sands of Time,2021-01-26T01:36:45Z,1

"Why do you think it&#39;s ok for you to travel right now when no one is supposed to be traveling because there is a GLOBAL PANDEMIC??  Many, many jobs have been lost to this pandemic (including mine), businesses have been lost, MANY industries have suffered huge losses &amp; everyone will be impacted for years to come. It is devastating, but we need to put public health first!  I can no longer work in my industry - I have to do something different, as do many.  We all have to adapt &amp; make sacrifices during this time.  You are not special or different.  Sorry that you don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening, but NO ONE DOES. What you are doing is incredibly irresponsible - I don&#39;t care how many negative tests you get.  This thing is changing everyday &amp; we are finding out new things about it every single day, such as the fact that you can still be infected even if you test negative.  You are not only putting yourself at risk, but others too &amp; it is attitudes and behaviors like yours that is causing this thing to spread and kill more people every single day.   You need to get real.",roaming gnome,2021-01-15T06:39:12Z,0

"Good day to you Eva..I love your adventures and that is so awesome you have been able to travel like you have and have been safe, too.  Iam 65 yes. Old and I have been traveling by myself meaning without my husband, but doing tours of different countries. I felt safer I suppose. But I do so enjoy being by myself. M0y husband doesn&#39;t want to travel and now with this China virus it has stopped. But the reason for me to write is to tell you that you are never alone. I believe the Bible as God&#39;s word to us and He says that He is with you always. He will never leave nor forsake you. He is an ever-present help in time of need. He loves you so much! You&#39;re a beautiful soul and Jesus wants to be strong in your life, one who loves unconditionally and wants to forgive you of all sin and for u to be born again into Him! Life becomes so exciting and I don&#39;t mean churchy stuff of rules and regulations.  No,,,,but of a personal relationship! Its so awesome....he has kept you safe on the road and you&#39;ve actually had an angel placed over your life at birth! We all have!  But anyway I hope u don&#39;t mind me sharing this with you. Time is short...God is raising up a remnant of people who live for him and will do great works throughout the earth...we have healing and miracles happening here and people being delivered of addictions and healed...thanks so much for your life!",Jeanne Cronce,2021-01-07T19:02:17Z,0

"As a person who has spent the majority of his adult life on the road, I will say that for me that life was good. It made it hard for personal relationships, but I always knew that if I met the right person I would settle down. Now, with the pandemic what I did my whole life has been changed. Now, having had no choice but to sit still, I also find this freeing. There’s an old saying that my grandmother used to say; “Life isn’t going to get any better, if you’re always bringing the problem with you.” What I’ve come to realize is that you can own your own little place, have a life and still travel. Compromise is the key word here. So, I moved to Vancouver Island off the west coast of Canada.

"Had exactly the same Ford Focus for a great many years...and it‘s still running (though on its last leg, so to speak), though now under the steering of my ex-wife. ;-) jOurs is automatic, though - a luxury I searched for and found due to my American roots (and initial aversion to manual transmissions, like yours). But once you go manual, you‘re free! :-) Nice vibe in all the videos of yours I‘ve viewed so far (including the Albanian and Romanian hikes). Time to join your subscriber base and help you build those dreams of yours.... EDIT (after finishing this video): A huge thumbs-up on the kindness!!!! You nailed it. Generosity of spirit is the huge and wonderful phenomenon that can and should now go „viral“ in these virus-ridden times. Staying open to whatever others think and feel, withholding moral judgement and practicing acceptance, being in touch with one‘s own shadows that need attention in order to emerge as a more generous-spirited being, etc. This whole predicament can be a huge chance for humankind, and many are taking up the challenge. If only a critical mass of 10 or 15 percent of the population start to think and feel and act this way, then we can turn so many things around! Sure, it won‘t happen in a year or two (more like a decade or two?), but let‘s get started. Every small gesture of humanity reverberates far beyond the place it is given! You are obviously living and adventuring on that principle, so it‘s great that your channel is apparently prospering and reaching a lot of souls, inspiring them to do the same, or similar, by your shining example.",Scott Becker,2020-12-15T14:06:54Z,0

"I hear people again and again say that they are trying to “find themselves”, in your case “what do I really want?”, what they are really saying is that they are continually rejecting what IS in themselves or in their lives. We can’t find ourselves because we can’t lose ourselves; every feeling every thought, and the quality of life that they bring IS the self! React, and suffering results. Receive with tender attention, and fullness results. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and likewise ugliness and limitation are also in the eye of the beholder. The word be-hold says it all: we are always holding ourselves each moment in our beings, and how we hold is how we experience being held. This is the reality of the Now. ( Richard Moss paraphrased )<br />You asked for some wise insights, I offer this: hold yourself in the highest part of your being with complete trust in the process of life. There is no need for agonizing over what to choose, simply open yourself up and breathe, and say “I breathe therefore I receive!” And do just that, with tender attention. If you find yourself “trying” stop! Because trying is lying, yours is not a journey that accepts the possibility of failure, make a choice, do or do not, those are your options, there is no value in playing the part of a victim of abundance, spare us those “first world problems”, the question is not “what do I want ?”, but “how do I want to receive ?” When the mind is perfectly clear, what IS, is what we want.",Daniel Brooks,2020-12-02T18:28:10Z,0
"You can settle down and still keep travelling occasionally when the wanderlust bubbles up: Just rent out your place to other travelers who come to <i>your</i> country (wherever you decide to settle down) airBnB style, maybe have a local friend keep an eye on the place so it stays clean / doesn&#39;t get totaled by squatters.  You could stay away for months, and renting out your place will supply some basic funding for your travels, when you&#39;re done wandering you still have a place to come home to.<br /><br />Also, any explanation why there&#39;s a random door standing in your backyard? 😂",Rey Nemaattori,2020-12-02T14:23:09Z,0

"Your energy is so rare and beautiful. Good luck on any journey. You&#39;re so good at listening to your intuition. Do what makes you happiest. 🙂<br />I went travelling for a few years and could not see myself living anywhere until I met someone in London and I&#39;ve lived there for the past 7 years lol <br />We&#39;ve done some travelling together since then but I do wish I could have done more... at the same time I understand that we always wish that that we could have done certain things and life. As you said the grass does seem greener at times.<br />It&#39;s funny because now I&#39;ve been called for completely different things...my journey is beginning again, but I&#39;m learning in life it is important to listen to those calls and to listen to your own happiness as things will work out best for you when you do so.<br />I&#39;m getting closer to 30 now and struggle with wanting to settle down or do more but I&#39;ve decided to stop listening to society and do what I want. (In a positive way)<br />I&#39;m healthy, I&#39;m still really young and anything is really possible. <br />Your videos really helped me during some tough times and reminded me about this sparkle that we all have have. (And made me want to solo travel again!)<br />It reminded me also of a woman I met a few years back who I swear looked 30 and she ended up being almost 70! She was some what of a world traveler too, and I promise you have never felt energy as beautiful as hers and you remind me of her 🙂<br />I know you&#39;ll be more than fine ❤ <br />Oh and we have a spare room in london and a Frenchie if you ever want to visit 😄",Ally,2020-12-02T12:43:57Z,1

"I recently listened to a german podcast about finding your passion, finding that one thing in life. The Girl from the podcast had a friend who was also travelling 2 years long and he told her, that he doesn‘t know if this is what he wants anymore. He actually wanted to settle somewhere. He said he needed contrast. I think maybe you need contrast too! Life is like a river! There isn‘t one thing you do all live long and are absolutely passionate about. But there is one thing you do for a period of time that you are absolutely passionate about. But then after time you need a contrast to it. Traveling maybe an adventure and you experience diverse things, still after 2 year travelling can become just traveling and isn‘t that diverse anymore because you do it all the time.<br />I hope I could help you ❤️🥰",MeryLery MSP,2020-11-30T21:46:37Z,0

"We as individuals do not really have any foundation, I think living like a tiny part of a larger world while being connected to it at heart is the key. <br />Your idea of kindness is a real deal, because compassion is the deepest form of intelligence and truth, it comes naturally if you stop focussing on so called self.. 👍😃",Pranav Nath,2020-11-15T11:27:33Z,0

"acknowledge the points made but cant agree entirely - maybe its a new scarey world for those who only live for pleasure and sensory, and those lacking maturity to cope with life struggles such as disappointment, not having complete choice of doing as you please.  The suspicion and negativity comes from people not controlling themselves regarding Corona by those who care.  We will all have even less freedoms and this will go on for longer throughout the world if we dont respect what needs to be done regarding social distancing and other measures, including not travelling around.  It is about the common good rather than feeling uncomfortable with the individual self feelings.",F B,2020-11-13T01:41:45Z,0

"The end of last year, I came up with the crazy idea that I wanted to travel to Bulgaria, Romania&#39;s neighbor. I had planned to travel this year, however, covid-19 and a heart attack set me back to next year. My wife has no desire to travel and discover the wonderful rural countryside of a nation where she would not understand the language. I will be 63 years old November 3rd, 2020.<br />I need to find a traveling companion for sure. May God bless you and keep you safe.",Charles Radar,2020-11-02T20:55:02Z,0
"Lovely vlog, great insights, thank you! You know that decision to travel or have a tiny home with garden and horse does not have to be either-or, in these times as you mentioned in the vlog, flexibility is the key. You can do a bit of both. We have been taught to think, to control our every move, but this is an illusion, there is no control, there is only flow in each moment. Follow your heart, because it will never betray you. We are entering a great period of change and I speak of this not in pessimistic terms, but optimistically. In this decade we will start building a world that many of us have dreamed about for years. So, grab the popcorn and enjoy the show.",Atticus Kilby,2020-11-02T14:37:48Z,0

"I&#39;ve watched so many videos of yours, but today, you ask your listeners on how you distinguish between what it is that you really want?<br />Fickleness of mind sometimes is our worst enemy. If you change like the chameleon at every step of your journey towards your goals, you can never steady in your search for success. Your mind is the root of your desires. When it creates confusion of many wants and needs simultaneously, it misguides you to jump from goal to goal not knowing the real purpose of your activity. Short term goals become obstacles in dedicating yourself to long term achievements. When your heart tells you that you have listened to its call and done what your conscience tells you, you&#39;re sure to be on the way to achieving what you really want. Purity here means being consistent in purpose, thought, speech and action. If your purpose is clear; your thoughts are in consonance with your purpose; your speech is clearly expressive of your thoughts and your actions are based on this continuous process, then your actions and attitude will be pure and successful. Observing self-imposed rules and regulations too gives you a sense of purity and generates happiness in your life. After all, who can draw the lines of control in your life better than yourself?  But once you have determined the scope of your duties and responsibilities and defined the kind of person you wish to be, be faithful to your image of yourself and do not swerve from your ideals unless you wish to rewrite your life-plan in an improve, better manner. Btw ...always enjoy your journey. Surrender to your higher intelligence, which should guide you in making the best use of your abilities and time to chart out your path to success.💚🌠 subbed ☀️✌️",Armando Soriano,2020-11-02T09:02:54Z,0

"Should I stay or should I go? Great song, even better question.<br />I think you’ve already done more already at your age than most people do in a lifetime. I’m 48 and have lived on 4 continents, have travelled, have run, been running for a long time. Only recently did I work out that it’s okay to stop and stay.<br />Keep asking these questions though, never stop asking the questions. You just don’t have to go to extremes to ask the questions.<br />You want to stay a while…stay. You can travel and explore and ask questions at any age. Sometimes you need to stop for a while to let all the experiences sink in and percolate. This will answer some questions and will create new questions, new directions, new interests.<br />It’s ok to want a simple life. You’ve already touched a lot of people around the world with your vlog, so that even if you stopped now, you could still look back and be proud. Unless you want/need to change the world? If not, allow yourself to find beauty in the simplest of things and enjoy what life has to offer.<br />The best things in life are free…<br />Food for thought, I hope so. Whatever direction you choose, own it, no regrets.",James Hawkins,2020-10-21T21:18:04Z,0

About being able to walk barefoot, to get a dog, settling down, a horse, a small place in nature, having an old but loyal car, the feeling in the forest and how the world is changing in such a strange way.

"To anyone out there, keep your hands at the bottom of the steering wheel (or the sides of it), not at the top, especially if you live in America. If you have an accident with the car the airbag tends to blow your arms off in this setup. It&#39;s fine with European cars, but the Americans need to be able to hold all your weight even if you have not strapped yourself.<br />As to the manual gearboxes, yes, it&#39;s a bit confusing at first and you need to be thought (preferably in a car with the pedals on both front seats) But after a day or two it gets in your muscle memory and you don&#39;t even think about it. It comes down to - listen to the engine noise, clutch in, put into gear... if the engine is revving, go one up, if it&#39;s sluggish, go one down. That&#39;s all.<br />Right foot on the throttle and break pedals, left on the clutch only, never mix them.",svily0YT,2020-10-21T08:59:12Z,0

I don&#39;t know but I cried so much on that part when you cried expressing your fears facing the vast ocean. I really felt you at that time.<br /><br />No wonder why you travelled with one of the most beautiful and remarkable vloggers. You both have these braveness in exploring the wonders and beauty of the world. You are in good hands with mikmik as we fondly call him here in the Philippines. I hope you could visit to our country and freedive in the depths with Sherlyn, the gf of one of Mike&#39;s friend here staying in Moalboal, Cebu. So, you can totally erase that fear.<br /><br />Again, congrats Eva. You are one of a beautiful soul. God bless you both in your travels! ☺️🎉❤️🙏",Juliet Ferolino,2020-10-20T06:17:32Z,0

I also get that feeling with your vids, sadness of your completed journey but the excitement of you currently being somewhere else, doing something else.  I agree, make plans, fight to stick to them, keep plans of exciting things at least 6 months in front of yourself!  Also plans are my Plan B, just a direction to go, make adjustments as life happens and locals give you more information on exciting new things to do and see.

"Thanks for this vlog. Life is indeed different at the moment and we agree that there&#39;s a lot of hate out there now. We are of those who try to spread the truth through social media and we receive a lot of negativity and are called selfish and inconsiderate of those who are very scared, and we have to keep reminding ourselves that we are doing through love for everyone that we share this planet with as well as for future generation. We&#39;ve moved up in the mountains of Spain where life still is somewhat normal and being in nature keeps us sane. We&#39;ve adopted an abandoned dog and we&#39;re slowly building a campervan. We didn&#39;t think we would do that, not yet. We&#39;ve been travelling since we met 10 years ago and it&#39;s weird to stop and kind of settle, but it&#39;s what&#39;s best for us now.

"You ask - how do you know what you really want. But what you really want may be all of these things, and that&#39;s ok. One thing that really helped me in the past is realizing that you rarely make a choice forever. I think that finding your one true calling is an illusion, like the idea that you have one true soulmate. People grow and evolve throughout their life. There are many things out there for you. You can build a life with a house and a dog, and a few years later do something different. I am sure if you look at the last 5 years of your life, there have already been many changes. It&#39;s possible the next five years will again have that many changes!",Alice Lieutier,2020-10-16T14:48:58Z,0

"“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”<br /><br />― Rainer Maria Rilke<br /><br />PS &quot;Everything works out in the end, and if it is not working out, it is not the end&quot;",TheZenguitarguy,2020-10-15T23:37:57Z,11

"I wish I&#39;ve met spirited people like you when i visited Poland last August. I really like the country especially Krakow but I think most Poles doesn&#39;t like foreigners especially Asian. I was being very nice and respectful but most of the time i didn&#39;t really get good experience when i go to a restaurant, cafe or shops. I asked one of the local guy I&#39;ve met if what I&#39;ve experienced was typical, he said &quot;people must have mistaken me as Chinese&quot;. I dunno know what does it mean! May be because of Covid? I find the younger locals are more approachable like those who are working in Starbucks or Costa. As much as i wanna try local and traditional places but sometimes they just ignored me. Being a Filipino-Canadian, my experience in Poland was total opposite how we welcome and treat people regardless of your background. I don&#39;t think think all Europeans are like that because I also visited Greece and Amsterdam and people their are quite welcoming and nice. I was quite disappointed because I grew up admiring the Pope that&#39;s why I was excited to visit his country. Cheers!",Davis Urdaneta,2020-10-15T13:46:37Z,0

"That&#39;s exactly what I notice these days as well and what I worry about: Nobody trusting anyone and shying away from each other because thinking other people might infect you. But I really hope it will go the other way and once the situation passes we will all hug each other and party like crazy. Or we go the wrong way and continue to mistrust each other and stick to only family/close friends, avoiding everyone else (I see this often also comes with a nationalistic tone or of a tone of blaming people that travel for doing so - as if travel was the only problem that caused Covid). I think it will be half/half, some people going back to kindness, exploring other cultures and being nice to each other, and others just sticking to themselves and their little part of the world.",Jakob Miller,2020-10-14T19:20:41Z,1

Congratulations for being, quite literally, the most annoying travel vlogger I have seen on YouTube. Ever. To understand this statement in context: I have managed to watch 7 or 8 videos by LostLeBlanc and I thought he took the cake. I was wrong. I was oh so very wrong. You are. The title goes to you, Eva Zu Beck. Absolutely unbearable. I struggled to get through this click-bait of a video hoping that something would improve, that something would endear me to you (perhaps the bit where you fed Lola?) But, no, I kept secretly wishing that Lola would lunge at your face. Needless to say, this (first video) will be the last video I watch on your channel. May the algorithm never bring you across my path again. Please do the world a favour and take your self-involved nose-stuck-up-your-own-ass preachy bullshit and get a house somewhere with that loser that briefly appeared in your video, and don&#39;t film anymore.

"Great vlog as always, I&#39;m 66 have traveled to many parts of the world too, often alone, sometimes with company, sometimes stayed in a house, sometimes on my yacht, I think the answer is if you are connected to the universe, you do what is right for you at the time, there have been very few regrets, a lot of happiness, a lot of exploring different cultures and people ,food, customs, my advice is to go with your institution and instincts, if it feels comfortable with someone in your life enjoy it, if you can&#39;t adjust, then that person is not the right one at this time, but if you can, there is something special sharing experiences with a loved one, maybe, like me, I have a home base now and a loved one, but still travel, still explore and experience what the universe brings me to look and see.

"Interesting perspectives. I think it is only in the west that the post pandemic world is distrusting and full of uncertainty. China is now post-COVID. The only major country to be so. The country&#39;s response has made the people more certain about their future, more confident about pursuing their hopes and dreams, and more confident that their choice of system of government is the right one for them. The things happening outside of the Middle Kingdom only reinforce to all Chinese that their country is heading in the right direction. 1.4 billion people is not an insignificant portion of the world",dyong888,2020-10-14T09:32:59Z,0

Especially in these times,sister,go to any forest and you might not find the cure but you will certainly find everything you need to prevent and even to ease most symptoms (like that clover flower you picked in the beginning treats coughs and fever). Forrests don&#39;t ask nothing in return.They give and they give.Thanks for showing them some love.Enjoy Romania,barefoot is the best!

"It&#39;s the dilemma between what you want and what you need. Like any protagonist of her own story. What you want is to keep traveling, to keep exploring, to expand your horizons, network and business. What you need is something else, and you need to give yourself the permission to pursue it. That&#39;s the challenge, isn&#39;t it? Is it OK to settle down, to grow roots, and to pace oneself against the rhythm of another? Will it propel me, or hinder me? Can I bite into that apple without regrets? The growing need to have a dog, a horse, and some land is but a signal that you are ready to nest. But here is the good news: It&#39;s up to you to design your life with &quot;Ands&quot; instead of &quot;Ors&quot;. You can grow roots AND travel, instead of having to choose between the two. You can have a primary home AND a secondary home, instead of having to decide one way or another. The diversity of your experiences affords you to anchor a while, just like you did your car, and slowly explore the forest within; not be terrified but open, and patient.",Amr Assaid,2020-10-12T22:01:39Z,0

"I am romanian living currently in US, God bless you for the beautiful stories about my country and breathtaking images from our secular forests, last ones in Europe. I traveled a lot and know how it feels to always be on the road. From my point of view, it’s not a sustainable lifetime in terms of mental and emotional wellbeing. People need a place not only to come back to, but where they feel safe and stable, where they can build a real community, and have absolutely normal and healty habits: gardening, cooking, cleaning, growing a family. Although attractive and dangerously addictive, the virtual world is still virtual and steals you life, little by little.

"Eva, the Siberian Taiga may be a nice place to just vanish for a season.  I don&#39;t know exactly when, but what&#39;s coming to our world will be exceedingly dreadful and there is no stopping it; many will perish.  You must find your people, your community (wherever you are), do what only you do (and you do you so very well I might add).<br /><br />You are bare footed, which means you are grounded.  Life giving, healing energy can flow freely into you and through you, giving your cells charge, replenishing your bio systems.  Similarly, this is how you must approach our reality, be bare, be vulnerable, be raw, be genuine, be true, be you, and virtue will find you.  Take off your m**ks, breath unencumbered, aspirate!  Feel and know the truth with each breath.  Perfect love casts out fear and heals ALL.<br /><br />What does nature teach you?  What does the collective ideologies and consensus of our world teach you by contrast, and what can you extrapolate out of, and absorb from these which may benefit you thereby?  There&#39;s only one way which is perfect and right.  Walk after Love, the foundation of creation, and fear not.  Though a tempest is upon us, love and wisdom will lead you, direct you, teach you, protect you, and comfort you and yours.<br /><br />Love and respect!

I absolutely understand one‘s need for privacy and noone asks you to share personal things, but this is as vague and unpersonal as it gets.

"If you want to see kindness in action , look up “the nomadic movement” on YouTube. Jason and Kalley are building something worthwhile in Panama. Of the 5 or 6 cloggers we follow they are the only ones focussed on creating things for others. Kindness costs.

The pandemic will end and yes the world will be a different place and Covid has changed many things. The one thing that has changed is where many people will spend their working lives as the days of large offices are over for people will be working from home or even while they are travelling.<br />For you are that you can work wherever you are and still have a home base between travels as it is nice to come to a place that you can call home as one gets older priorities change it’s one thing to be running all over the shop in your twenties but by the time you hit your forties even your thirties you want to be settled.<br />You will work out what you want to do 👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-10-12T06:08:01Z,2

"As you asked for some wisdom, I shall channel my inner Yoda! Many people do a variety of different things throughout their careers. What may be all consuming at one point in life, may be modified or replaced with other interests.<br /><br />Also, when you go really hard at a particular endeavor for, say 2 1/2 years, well, you might just need a break! Perhaps its time to relax a bit without the stress and energy of continual travel, and see what plans for the future, perhaps post COVID, that you might develop. <br /><br />COVID may have given much of the world an unasked for break from life. Some may not do much, while others will risk their lives on the front line, or be in school diligently studying, while some who have lost their jobs are going through a process of re-invention of themselves. <br /><br />For me, instead of just focusing on financial investment and real estate development, I am finishing up my jazz-60&#39;s-70&#39;s violin cd, and my book on Reversing Heart Disease, both of which are far more important than my business pursuits that pay the bills. Along with the usual training for my 26th marathon...whenever it will be safe to run that. <br /><br />So....your mind and body may be telling you to take a step back, and not kill yourself with all of the traveling that you have done. Just because you traveled intensively for 2 1/2 years doesn&#39;t mean you have to do that for the next 40 years. But....you have had experiences and an understanding of people and culture from around the world that very few have. From that,  you soon may have many great opportunities that will be presented. Wow, it sounds like those words might have just come straight from a Chinese fortune cookie! <br /><br />I end with my favorite quote, which is to &quot;follow your dreams and enjoy the trip&quot;. Truly you have been doing that, but every now and then our dreams change, and that allows for experiences that we might not even be able to imagine just yet. <br /><br />Be true to yourself.  Particularly if when traveling with somebody, if the pro&#39;s are outweighed by the cons. If freedom that is so necessary is sacrificed, that may merit reassessment. Ask yourself if you can be at the very top of your game with whomever your partner is. That is good advice for not only travel, but life.<br /><br />You always have my good wishes Eva zu Beck. You also have my great respect for doing that bike ride across Poland, with hardly any preparation, while carrying a lot of weight with all of your camping equipment. That took a great combination of guts and courage, along with a  wonderful dose of naievete. Also, great kudos for running a marathon in temps approaching 100 degrees. That was seriously a major accomplishment. <br /><br />Ms. zu Beck...follow your heart, but use your very good head, and you will choose the right fork in the road for your next adventure, perhaps from a home base. Maybe you would rent a home for a year, and do your thing. After all, stability is something that may become more attractive as one progresses on this journey of life.  <br /><br />I thank you for enhancing my understanding of the world and of the good people in it.    <br /><br />Be well, <br /><br />Randy",Randy Lazer,2020-10-12T03:06:55Z,0

"Really? August 1975, my mom taught me to drive a stick shift, an automatic transmission. <br /><br />I was 15 and a half, my first car. I am now over 60. <br /><br />Will never forget one time when my little sister was in the back seat. She kept repeating UGH, UGH, UGH when I was new to what a clutch was. <br /><br />Today? A fond memory. Back then? Could have killed her on the spot, lol! <br /><br />How are you going to finance the inherent repairs for such an old car coming down the pike, your future? Tens of thousands of US dollars? <br /><br />When you need a new part for an old car, you will need at least $3-$5 Thousand Dollars, the car will be in the shop for a week or two, how will you get about to get groceries, work or pay rent, etc? Does that Country even have parts readily available? If so, where? And at what cost will it take for the part to get to the shop, shop labor hours to pull put the parts, to get to the part, to replace said part, then put it all back together? <br /><br />Long-term financial planning is in short order, aka, now. <br /><br />A medical emergency? <br /><br />Medical insurance, co-pay (aka medical deductible, the part you pay after the health insurance company pays their share?)? <br /><br />Retirement funds? <br /><br />401k&#39;s. <br /><br />You are financially in over your head, sweetheart.

"Eva, did you know that the province of Bukovina is the main home of the polish minority in Romania??<br />Bukovina was famous in all of Central Europe as a land of tolerance, the place where a lot of ethnicities were living in harmony. Is also famous for the beautiful landscapes, and for the fact that although small in area, it gave a lot of personalities. Chernivtsi, its historical capital, now in Ukraine, is known for the beautiful architecture, and for being one of the cultural centers of Ukraine.<br />Is also famous for being, toghether with Maramures, a region where traditions are still kept quite intact.<br />But the biggest thing for wich Bukovina is renowned, and made it a brand, is the religious treasure, specifically the painted monasteries, a UNESCO site.<br />And not the least, Bukovina is the place where Principality of Moldavia originated, and where the well known Prince Stephen the Great ruled the country from the city of Suceava (there is a big fortress there).<br />I hope that maybe you will make a video showing what this magical place has to offer.<br />Btw, the polish minority lives in compact comunities around the town of Gura Humorului.",Nick Radevits,2020-10-12T01:07:35Z,1

"Barefoot is the way to go.   We were meant to be barefoot and our feet were not meant to wear shoes.    Matter of fact, being in healthcare and treating feet, of those that I see with major chronic foot issues like bunions, hammer toes, plantar fasciitis, it is due to wearing and thus being dependent of shoes.   Wearing shoes a whole life leads to a foot that is thin and dainty, not being able to handle to much.  Living barefoot crates a robust foot that can handle so much more.   Great job Eva and making the jump.    Once you go barefoot, it really is hard to go back.",mtbin2,2020-10-12T00:34:47Z,1

"Dear Eva, by the way i love to watch ur every vlog but this one very special, really special for me in a sense that besides of new place, people you interact with, and besides of many beautiful surprises you disclose to us but here you just spread love at its peak, so nice your every word, inspiration, reality and  motivational speech about your own and ongoing life. Besides like whatever you want to do, you want to make it at is perfection. Like you want to do usual but more real even. Something that make you satisfied with generous and kindness like beyond of its aspect horizons that is not usual but more real. You love nature and love is usual but real too. Things will get better regarding the ongoing situation of covid restrictions InshaAllah means hopefully and their will be no disappointment and uncertainity for sure.<br />This world is too big but too small sometime when you just found your mate that perfectly match what ur inspiration is about life and all ur plans about it.<br />I dont know you would love this idea but you love nature alot like ur life it is without any doubt becoz life itself a wisdom of master peace of nature and than these landscapes, valleys, mountains, forests, fountains, rivers, islands, springs, natural resources, dogs, herds of sheeps, shepperds, people and all these new places you live with ur life. Did you ever try to explore who is behind this beautiful creator of nature that you just love all of ur life for what reason and how  this all about nature and life is really about what, as you travel throughout in life, explore amazing places as long as you can, but what was all about the objective of this beautiful life and nature and natural phenomena, that must be usual but real, what is that real behind life and nature. Like Sun rises east everyday, earth is round and that is usual but what is real about it that make it happening, making and changing our perspectives, imaginations that beyond our thinking. <br />Remember The good thing is that you are at the finish line like in a race and you are just close to it, all you just need is a sense to feel it.<br /><br />And your weapons for life are just perfectly match to it kindness and generous approach towards life, likw do something for others particularly what others cant. But even in kindness and your all mood of life you always want to fill the gape that is necessary in ur point of view. You want to do something about anything that usually others do not, like you travel to places where others usually do not. Now when it comes to about life, belonging relationship a tiny home you live with, you want to make it but the way that usually others do not, something more into reality, like dreams come true not particularly for urself but for someone you belong with, like you go to places that deserve for its speciality that make a reason for u to visit, now i guess you want the same about belonging and relationship balance in life that is deserving for any particular reason. Congrats You are really generous and kind person, the rest you know very well that the world belongs to brave and you are brave enough too.<br />Sending you warm loveful hugs and love of sweet kisses. You might never note but you are very romantic too perfectly deserve for romantic belonging in life.<br />I really now perfectly more strongly belief that as much as this world is bigger for one hard to find whatever he wants the same it is small for you to find it but it is all about ur fate, it is all about what you are really striving for but nothing you can snatch.<br />Best wishes to you always Eva and wish you stay blessed, may almighty shower countless blessings upon you. Amen",Abdul Basit Khan,2020-10-11T23:22:29Z,0
Eva love this video honestly though everyone needs a place they call their own where ever in the world you choose that to be find your perfect place and make it your own the world isn’t going anywhere she will be waiting for you when you get there.

"Hi Eva! I love your videos. You mentioned wanting to settle and also wanting to travel. Have you considered living in or renting a tiny house? These are on wheels, so you can move them to different places if you wanted to",Madeleine L.,2020-10-11T23:07:19Z,0
"Eva, I just recently discovered your travel blogs and binged them all. Your personality and energy are so uplifting and your solo female travels very much inspiring. Todays vlog there were suddenly so many parallels to my life, wanting a dog and a tiny home and I also just bought my first car, being super terrified to drive manual. I had to smile so much seeing the parallels. And I will continue watching your videos for you, not the travel. You can show us the calm forest and woods. I think it helps people stay sane in crazy times. Also your perspective on kindness is so beautiful and important. Just be you as always and everything else will fall into place. Enjoy your time in Romania. Looks amazing!",Maxi K.,2020-10-11T22:52:05Z,0
"I would like so much to have a car. I love traveling. But I realise cars are not compatible with grass, with forests, with quiet mind, with sleep, with oxygen, and I will travel by other means. And I hope more and more well intentioned people, like you, will give up cars. Just came back from a trip with some friends, who told me to join them to Brasov by car. It took us 5 h to drive back, the traffic was like a 150 km long snake. Last wk I went to the same destination, by train. It took 2hour of nice traveling, reading, and relaxing.",ChandChandramukhi,2020-10-11T22:36:00Z,0

I did when l was younger with my parents from UK by road to India, it was an experience l have never forgotten but alas, never repeated. You talk about the virus and kindness, l admire you for that but, again, alas, there are some stupid people in this world ignoring the restrictions, having house parties, gatherings, they assume they are immune, sadly they are not and just end up spreading the virus and there are some who lose their lives because of their ignorance.

"Settling down can be great. I used to think, well, your life is over. Even if it&#39;s not marriage I saw girlfriends as the same thing minus the receipt aka marriage certificate. Marriage isn&#39;t just a word. It&#39;s a sentence. But without someone else, you&#39;re nothing but an echo in time that cares fades away quickly into nothing. And I&#39;ve seen travel channels where a family in an RV, seven kids, traveled, then they somehow hauled them in various parts of the world. And even if just friends for a while, hey, skin hunger starves the soul and body. You have a positive message. I try to mind my manners but they don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;ve been watching a guy on YouTube sing to different girls why beer in better than women only because growing up Mormon in their stifling, suffocating environment and being told marry marry, do like Genesis says and multiply, and I&#39;m thinking more like Genesis the rock group, I got lost in myself while hiding from others cuz they&#39;re pretty abusive, mean, petty and will nag you to an early grave whether your Bishop, mom or female friends, but I think they tried to take charge of my life because I didn&#39;t take charge of it before they did. They thought, hold my Starbucks, you dunno how to use your life. But they&#39;re wrong. I was stunned, in a daze, literally. I&#39;ve had several concussions that would normally kill, and I had an epiphany. Everyone needs a purpose. Mine is to be myself. And people think. Oh really? That&#39;s it? That&#39;s all? But look what humanity has accomplished. That&#39;s inside us all and until you make you your priority you&#39;ll become nothing, be a nobody, because you see and treat yourself that way. Your positivity is a breath of fresh air. Thanks! 🖖🍻☕📷",Joseph Barney,2020-10-11T20:27:57Z,0

"An interesting dilemma.  You have certainly taken the road less traveled. Yours is the only travel Vlog that I actually follow with any kind of regularity.  Why? Because you have such fresh views and they are so positive. I&#39;ve learned A LOT from the places you&#39;ve traveled and the people you&#39;ve met. Thank you. Your approach to unique destinations REALLY open up ones eyes as a way to see people the way they are, not the way they are cast.  That is a rare talent.  You are not just a Westerner telling other Westerners to come see this place and people, you are equally respected by the persons and nations you travel in. One imagines that you could be an influential voice as a future diplomat, a UN representative, or NGO. More than just a vloger anyway (although I and may others will miss you).  <br /><br />As a professor, I&#39;ve done my own vagabond traveling even as I turned 50 after several years of more sedate traveling, so life doesn&#39;t have to switch off on a dime. I would only suggest that if you do go for the &#39;settled&#39; lifestyle that your consider continuing to get credentials, be they educational or otherwise, that will help bring your talents into wider spheres of influences.<br /><br />Wishing you a happy journeys and a wonder life.",Douglas Stemke,2020-10-11T20:10:37Z,78

"&quot;Being kind,. being generous with your time, with your attention... giving people the benefit of the doubt, finding points of commonality with other people&quot; - those are Islamic teachings (and teachings of other religions as well) . Some examples of Islamic teachings that match with you said  - &quot;Paradise the home of the generous&quot;,&quot;Do not be suspicious of people as suspicion can some times be a sin&quot;, &quot;Come together with a word you have in common&quot;.

"​@Mark S  you are the deceiver how could you say so??!! you&#39;re responsible  for what you&#39;re writing and saying before God <br />(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9o8pNRee6o&amp;t=17m36s"">17:36</a>) And pursue not that of which thou hast no knowledge; for every act of hearing, or of seeing or of (feeling in) the heart will be enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning).<br /><br />Allah is the most merciful and impossible for him to aggrieve anyone and ask us to kill anybody without reasons and restrictions <br />O My servants! I have forbidden oppression for Myself, and I have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.(hadeth)<br /><br />(60:8) Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.<br /><br />(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9o8pNRee6o&amp;t=2m19s"">2:19</a>0) Fight in the cause of Allah only against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors.<br /><br />(5:8) O you who have believed be persistently standing firm for Allah witnesses in justice and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just Be just; that is nearer to righteousness And fear Allah; indeed Allah is Acquainted with what you do.<br /><br />(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9o8pNRee6o&amp;t=5m32s"">5:32</a>) Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land – it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.",T S,2020-10-18T12:18:41Z,2

"Ahhh, yes - For a young person who travels owning a house, getting a pet and a relationship are &#39;commitments&#39; not to be taken lightly, but it&#39;s nice to see another video post from you and nicer still that you have found someone to share your time with.  However, these seem to conflict with the life of a traveler. <br /><br />I am curious that you found being stranded in Socotra as &#39;traumatizing&#39; - what was traumatizing about it???<br /><br />Be thankful that you are young and where you live you are still allowed travel; whereas in Canada there are travel restrictions and because of my age, I have been forced to self-isolate for the past 6 months with my travel plans up in limbo and postponed into most likely 2022.

"My father taught me how to drive in a 2000 Ford Focus, when I was 16, and the car was 9 years old.  The car had 500,000 kms on it. Due to the stiffness of the gears, I say it is one of the hardest cars to learn how to drive (or to re-learn it). But those cars are one of the sturdiest things for that price in the European market, and overall a good investment.

"I have observed that when I am out running, hiking, walking, while keeping physical distancing, wearing a mask, that while normally it would be disrespectful to move away from someone to maintain physical distancing, now while its understandable, something positive is that I have noticed when we do this, at least I wave a hello at the person. To acknowledge and thank them. They seem to always do the same. While during this pandemic, while what was, is something new, but honestly it seems to have brought us more closer as a community while experiencing the outdoors together.",Pro Consumer Safety,2020-10-11T16:32:41Z,2

"Thank you for a wise and insightful vlog. You captured the crux of our lives right now- a reset to the basic elements of life- kindness and respect for one another. It is so easy to step from this path. I think it is human nature, but also deep within all of us, we thrive on kindness. I think this global chapter has hopefully rekindled the notion that we all need the same basic glue to keep the balance.  This is what I miss most about travel- relating to one another on a very non-judgmental level, human to human. I try to be conscious to apply this second nature travel approach to every day situations and look forward to physical travel in 2021. Until then, may we all emerge and continue to be better, stronger, and kinder as a result. Thank you for your beautiful vlogs.",Maria Di Giovanni,2020-10-11T16:16:45Z,0

The more you drive, you will gain the confidence. Just do a weekly inspection and maintain its maintenance. Rust will be my biggest concern. The Future can become cloudy at times. What makes you happy and what pays the bills comes to my mind. I own a car and have reduced my belongings.

"LOL in America we pay twice the price for ripped shirts they are all the rage and style!<br />I enjoy your stories, one of my favorite part of your vlogs are the stories of people working with you teaching you or helping you to do something like, new learning to drive manual transmission, and the realizations you have or thoughts you have about life. Be flexible. A very good way to approach life at this point. Thanks for the vlog.  I&#39;m curious will you buy a home, get a horse and a dog and stay in Romania?",Cookingwithlove,2020-10-11T14:57:09Z,0
"It’s called pandemic psychosis. Get used to it. People predisposed toward bouts with manic episodes are having a very difficult time adjusting to the new reality. Offer help to neighbors, especially single parents with small children. Just knowing there’s someone close by to lean on in an emergency is huge. <br /><br />Thanks for the odd gate.

"Dear Eva - Im sharing you my personal life to some extent. DO what gives YOU happiness. Relationships dont last forever. Dont invest yourself in something you are not sure about.  Do buy one small house which should be YOUR comfort zone, which gives you a sense of security and peace.  But keep travelling.  You have only one life - Dont remain stuck with anything that is not worth being stuck with. Analyse, give it all a deep thought. <br />Travelling, meeting new people, knowing their stories, knowing their lives, knowing their culture, history , cuisine, traditions ect is an experience worth millions. Relationships and &quot;Settling down&quot; is not worth your time and your life.  Do what makes YOU happy. Dont make your choices having someone else in your mind. Be selfish. Think only for yourself and if  the other person respects it  he will stick to you thru all thick and thin. If not - better be alone.  ive been living alone on and off for over 15 years now and believe me when im saying this, you will NOT like the sound of another human for long when you have been so used to being alone.  I cannot tolerate someone talking to me for more than an hour. I cannot tolerate a company for more than a few hours. I want to go back to my &quot;peace&quot;  my &quot;space&quot; asap.  Think very deeply on WHAT YOU WANT. Nothing else matters.",Buddha Piyao,2020-10-11T14:53:49Z,1

Manual transmission cars are the most fun to drive, so I&#39;m glad you were courageous to learn how to drive manual transmission.<br /><br />Build a tiny little home, get a dog, get a horse. Do that for yourself and then continue travelling as well. Travelling is your passion, as is very apparent from each vlog you post. Not that many people have passion for something.

It&#39;s always the problem of many going against the few it the individual.<br /><br /><br />So in fact it&#39;s collectivism going against the individual person.l",upstreamer,2020-10-11T14:11:08Z,0

"Sister, please try to get a new AMT car instead of manual as u will find it difficult to drive in future. It&#39;s not good especially in a new age where everything has changed with new features like sun roof, cruise control, push start button, auto headlight, wireless charging, android auto/apple car play etc etc. So kindly sister change this one for a new ford Taurus.",1 1,2020-10-11T11:15:49Z,0
"I strongly disagree with your reasoning. <br /><br />That Focus probably cost less than 1000€ and that gives you so much freedom. You don&#39;t worry as much with an older cheap car, because in its 17 years it already got so many bumps and scratches and if the car breaks, replacement parts can often be bought for cheap at a scrapyard...Also, when you leave it behind in a less save area, it is far less likely to be stolen. <br /><br />There would&#39;ve been one reason you could&#39;ve mentioned, that would&#39;ve been a valid point: modern cars are saver, because there have been great improvements in the last 20 years. <br /><br />But do you really think Eva is the kind of person that needs a start stop button or cruise control in her car?",Niklas,2020-10-11T11:26:50Z,0

Did you watch and listen to the video? Did you hear Eva&#39;s message of being compassionate towards others? If Eva wants to answer for herself she will. If not, then Rahat will have to accept no answer. You are not Eva&#39;s mouthpiece . . .",dav snow,2020-10-11T12:04:23Z,11
