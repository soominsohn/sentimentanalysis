"Yemen is beautiful before war, why Arab love to killing and war each others? just because of different sect(i know Shia 12 iman are different from Zaidi-Sunni-Ibadi, Shia 12 in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon almost similar to Alevi and alawi/nusariyah). Many Yemen historical site, historical building, ancient and medieval old city, old fort, old castle, old palace, old mosque, old city gate, old city wall, ancient ruins, beutiful arab house, traditional arab wooden door and windows now destroyed. look at Europe, how beautiful medieval city they have. Paris, London(famous with London Tower, many Castle, Palace and old city). Yemen, Iraq, Libya is example rich country but become poor because of Arab leader. Having Monarchy not bad at all. it more stable, Jordan which lack of resource become stable and beautiful, clean, Morocco beautiful many old medieval citadel, fort, castle, palace, mosque, gate, city wall, like Fez, Casablanca, Tangier, Rabat and many more. Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi, UAE, Bahrain, Oman are stable. Yemen make mistake. I hope yemen will rebuild, clean, and more tourism will come. Yemen lucky not like Sub-saharan africa like Congo, Central Africa Republic, Cameroon, Namibia, South Sudan, Lesotho, Senegal, Kenya(except Fort build by Oman Arab and Portuguese), Tanzania(same fort build by Arabs, like Arab fort Zanzibar and Stone city Zanzibar), Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Australia which not beautiful medieval city which pride of nation. Yemen are good people like Oman, Yemen currency should be like Kuwaiti, Omani, Qatari, Saudi or at least Jordanian which better to US Dollar at least half of US dollar. Iraq do mistake blame King. but dictator are more worst than KIng/Monarchy im not pro Monarchy but Arab King do many go thing. Libya, Yemen and Iraq will be rich country if Arab of Libya, Yemen and Iraq do not have jealous, sentiment in their heart. blaming others, blaming rich are not good. that why Socialist fail.",Safuwan Fauzi,2020-01-20T09:39:23Z,0

Also the huge military presence on the island makes people fear UAE will never leave the island when the war in Yemen ends.
