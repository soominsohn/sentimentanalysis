I hope one day I get to experience that 🙏 side note: I believe there&#39;s an interesting story about the dolphins and humans on how they lived together with a high intelligence and were able to communicate with one another.  Something like that...I think or I could be making it up lol,"TAROT, DREAMS & EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN",2021-01-05T02:31:46Z,0

Absolutely beautiful just seeing the dolphins and the emotional reaction of your experience .<br />I’ve seen dolphins many times and even had some swim close to me while I was in the water and I still get a thrill seeing them and the location was simply epic.<br />Also every time I see snakes in the Bush I still get a rush because as you say the best things in life are free and they do come when you least expect them and then you see the beauty of lie all you gotta do is step out of the front door 👍👍👍👍👍👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2019-12-27T05:40:08Z,1

"My dear gullible western minded lady, remember what happened to the couple cyclists/tourists just like yourself visiting the Middle/far East Tajikistan. U think u know the Middle East by just sleeping in the desert with some friendly Bedouin’s. ISIS/Islamists r everywhere in that region. Wise up and save your life for a better cause. Good luck.",Jake Zgab,2019-12-26T14:12:41Z,1
"ISIS has been eradicated by the Kurdish and Iraqi military since last year. Only few scattered in Syria. Plus, if we assume that they were still to be here, they&#39;re located in Iraq and Syria. If you look at the map, Oman is waay far from that region to the south. And just so that you know, Isis does not represent Islam whatsoever, they&#39;re like the KKK in america, which no one believes them to be Christians. Consider this an informative comment because we are not here to discuss politics.",Kamal AL-Hinai,2019-12-26T17:12:44Z,2
"haha, well thanks for your concern, but i have never had anything bad happen to me in the middle east. i have, however, been groped many times in London. i guess it&#39;s not the location but the people you stumble upon.  i will definitely continue travelling in this part of the world 😄",Eva zu Beck,2019-12-26T16:44:07Z,2
Jake Zgab wtf are you talking about? you clearly look like you live in a bubble. Have you ever read about Oman ? Cuz I live in Oman and there’s is no terrorism or isis! Oman has 0% percent of terrorism. Oman is the safest country in the world. 😇,Sultan Al-kalbani,2019-12-26T14:41:26Z,2
