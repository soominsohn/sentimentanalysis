@Moselle Conger i mean as long as she is with them she will be fine .. but it is interesting how human nature works in such situations.. u would think she would not stand being stranded in a desert by her self but when someone is in such a situation u could never expect how they would react .. there is a book I read a while ago about a Hungarian journalist that came to work in Saudi Arabia and was left stranded in the desert and he talked about how he felt at that time .. the name of the book is the road to mecca. check it out if u have time.,سارا,2021-04-28T14:41:38Z,0

"THE VATICAN OWNS EVERYTHING<br />Justin Taylor | Genesology<br /><br />The Vatican Owns Everything<br /><br />On 18 November 1302, Pope Boniface VIII issued the Papal Bull called &quot;Unum Sanctum.&quot;<br /><br />Aside from all that was written, the bull ends with the following statement:<br /><br />“Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.&quot;<br /><br />Since the bull declared that the Roman Pontiff has supreme control over the material world, he states that the body (our body) is governed by the soul and the soul is governed by the ruler of the spiritual, therefore - the Roman Pontiff is Governor of both Soul and body.<br /><br />Basically, what it is saying is that all of the Souls in the world belong to the Roman Catholic Church and apparently, at least in theory, they do ... because no one has dared challenged their claim. Your birth certificate is the title of the Soul that they own in their registries. They have registered you and that is the title to your Soul. Like the bank holds the title to your car because you are indebted to them. In fact, your Social Security card is issued to you with your name in all capital letters ... which indicates chattel to a Corporation. We are inventory.<br /><br />The Roman Catholic Church has a very long history of tyranny and oppression dating back to the very beginning of it&#39;s organization. Because of their desire to control through their crusades and inquisitions, they decided they would create the first Express Trust, called &quot;Unam Sanctum&quot; which was written on a papal bull and placed in their vault. Remember, there are 66 miles of shelving in that vault locked away underground beneath the Vatican.<br /><br />On the papal bull, it says that all of the souls in the world belong to the Roman Catholic Church and they technically do, because no one has challenged their claim. Your Birth Certificate is essentially the title of the Soul that they own in their registries. They have registered you and that is the title to your Soul. Given that there is a small group of Global Elite who control all the world&#39;s finances, military, and ecclesiastical resources, this would not be too difficult to believe.<br /><br />The Inquisition began because many people were waking up to the tyranny and oppression of the Roman Catholic Church in the early 1300’s. The RCC killed these people due to their need to control humanity. And kill they did. In the millions it is estimated. And it wasn&#39;t pretty. Not even Stephen King could come up with some of the ways they &quot;tortured and disposed&quot; of people who opposed them. 200 years later during the Renaissance, the Hermetica (based upon the Ancient Wisdom and teachings of Hermes) was available, which is where the Bible draws all of its inspiration from, along with previous civilizations and their rituals and beliefs. This knowledge was also suppressed by the RCC ... for centuries.<br /><br />Global Elite families control the Vatican and the Corporation (the incorporation of the Apostle Peter). They also control the US Military, and the London Financial District - all three of which are independent city/states. The control center is the Crown Temple Syndicate. The Washington DC private corporation Federal Estate is actually owned and controlled by the London Crown Temple Syndicate. The Syndicate, through the House of Windsor, owns approximately 1/6 of the Earths land surface. But I digress ...<br /><br />In 325 CE, the emperor, Constantine the Great, made a donation to his Pope, Sylvester saying, “Saint Peter is the Apostle of Jesus of whom Jesus gave this kingdom of Earth to, therefore we are going to claim taxes.” We pay taxes to Rome, the Khazarian and Venetian Black Nobility elite families based on a fictional document from Constantine issued the year of the First Council of Nicea and the creation of what has become modern day Christianity.<br /><br />Because of a decree written by Pope Nicholas V in 1455, the RCC owns everything, Even what you think you might own such as your car, house or even the pair of shoes you are wearing belongs to the RCC (in their twisted minds). That 4th of July thing? Foggetaboutit. The good &#39;ol USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Crown and a full-blown Corporation. It began as &quot;The Virginia Company,&quot; and then ultimately became, &quot;The United States of America Corporation.&quot;<br /><br />We can also thank Pope Gregory for the current Gregorian calendar, which rearranged the previous Julian calendar to match the Pagan holidays that the Roman Catholic Church now claims as Christian holidays. Do your research my friends. Things are not as they seem. It&#39;s a shell game, and they can put the ball wherever they want it to show up ... just like magic. Hide it under our nose, and we won&#39;t even see it. A coin, always two faces ... and nobody ever pays much attention to the side/rim that bind the two as one. Question everything ... everything.<br /><br />Just a thought ...<br /><br />Justin Taylor, ORDM., OCP., DM.",ethan mcdonald,2021-02-19T04:20:18Z,0

"Hardly do you find videos that discuss the complexities of female hygiene, toileting practices, childbirth, child mortality, customs concerning these aspects of life... we only get this is the living area, this is the kitchen, this is the sleeping area... oh &amp; those are the goats &amp; camels over there.",PerentieTut Adventurneering,2021-01-27T04:45:31Z,13
"That&#39;s always been my question as well about nomad life. Where do they go to the bathroom? What about women and their periods? And general hygiene? (I have heard that women used camel milk for bathing, cleaning their hair, etc.) I also wondered, with this video, how people lived before the advent of cars, water pumps, etc. I assume their camels lived right close to them, and that they camped near where they could find what little water there was. I know it&#39;s a bit weird, but I wish someone would write about those more personal and private things.",Quirky1,2021-03-15T06:08:13Z,0

"Mike Hunt<br />PARTICLE PHYSICS IN HOLY QUR&#39;AN <br /><br />The word &quot; ذرة &quot; used in this verse <br />means itom. Smaller than itom indicate that there are particles smaller than itom. Itom contains   electron and proton and.These particles are smaller than itom. <br /><br />و قال الذين كفروا لاتأتينا الساعة ، قل بلى وربى لتاتينكم علم الغيب لا يعزب عنه مثقال ذرة في السموات ولا في الأرض و لا اصغر من ذلك ولا أكبر إلا في كتب مبين  o<br />                                         ( سبأ : ٣)<br />Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay,  by my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the knower of the Unseen. Not an itom&#39;s weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Record&quot;.<br />                         (Qur&#39;an.Saba:3)<br /><br />Modern science knew this fact in 20th century. Who can say 1450 years ago that there are particles smaller than itom? <br />Only Almighty Allah Who created these particles.<br />Higs Boson particle is also created by Allah. It is not God.<br /><br />If yon see meaning of ذرة in Arabic dictionary you will come to know that this word means itom. It is written in all English-Arabic dictionaries.<br />You don&#39;t know Arabic. Learn and study more. It is in your interest <br />to believe in Almighty Allah and worship Him only and believe that prophet Muhammad is His last and final messenger.<br /><br />We believe in Jesus( pbuh) that he is prophet of Allah not God. Jesus never claimed the dignity. He was a Muslim and preached Islam as every prophet did from Adam to Prophet Mohammad(pbuh). <br /><br />Mohammad( pbuh) very clearly told his followers that he is a man like others but Allah choosed him and made him His last and final messenger.<br /><br />Muslims do not worship Mohammad<br />but they worship Almighty Allah as prophet Mohammad ( pbuh) taught them. Jesus like Mohammad taught his followers to worship Allah only. <br />The word father means the Lord. In Arabic He is called as رب( Lord)not God. <br />Hope it is very clear now for every followers of prophet Jesus(pbuh)<br /> <br />If we Muslims do not believe in Jesus as a prophet we are not Muslis and not acceptable to Almighty Allah.<br />If a follower of JESUS wants to go in Paradise after death they should revert to Islam earliest possible and work as prophet Mohammad taught <br />otherwise they may not enter into Paradise.<br />Almighty Allah bless all of us<br /><br />DR.MOHAMMAD LAEEQUE NADVI <br />Ph.D. (Arabic Lit.)

@Mama Marianovits what are human rights? A thing the west made up.,Ben Dover,2021-03-13T21:36:11Z,4
"Yes... and yet, a resounding no.!!<br /><br />One must always speak the truth, even when inconvenient or uncomfortable, though especially when the basic human rights of others are being trampled on, denied or denounced... always.!! <br />Not all cultures were created equal, with many permitting and committing human rights violations to one or more subsets of it&#39;s own. <br />So, while the op may have a beautiful view, albeit entirely naively so, on humanity and the acceptance of all the cultures therein, it simply is not so... nor ought it be. <br />I rather to agree with the creator of this video. There can be, and are, beautiful things to be found in this realm, often in other peoples and their cultures, but one must not be so ignorant or naive as to believe that one must accept ALL aspects of other cultures. That simply will not wash.",Mama Marianovits,2021-03-11T05:24:16Z,1

I had the chance and opportunity to go visit Jordan Israel back in the late eighties there was fighting going on there of course just like there&#39;s always fighting going on in the middle East but I remember the people and how wonderful they were they were so very nice not everybody is bad just like not everybody is bad here.    you have your good people and you have your not so good people and that&#39;s just globally but I will say the time that I spent there it was very wonderful the food was amazing and the people were very gracious to me.<br />It&#39;s sad what has happened in our country just recently.   I think globally everyone&#39;s suffering somewhere.   and some people are suffering more than others that&#39;s the saddest part about overpopulation.   Probably covid-19 was started to depopulate.    Who knows how it got here let&#39;s just hope we can get rid of it and let&#39;s just hope mankind can clean up their act and start acting right and treating each other regardless race color creed religion with dignity.      <br />No big tech companies or no big corporations have the right to pick and choose who gets to live and who doesn&#39;t.

Allah enjoined fairness, kindness, good treatment and rendering back trusts for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.</i><br /><br /><b>The Qur’an says:</b><br /><i>{Allah does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who have neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves those who are fair.}</i><br /><b>(Al-Mumtahanah 60:8)</b><br /><br /><br /><b>وَ مَاۤ  اَرۡسَلۡنٰکَ اِلَّا رَحۡمَۃً  لِّلۡعٰلَمِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۷﴾</b><br /><br /><i>اور ( اے رسولِ محتشم ﷺ! ) ہم نے آپ کو نہیں بھیجا مگر تمام جہانوں کے لئے رحمت بنا کر</i><br /><br /><i>And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad ﷺ], except as a mercy to the worlds.</i><br /><b>(Surah e Anbiya’ 107)</b><br /><br /><i>The Last Prophet’s mercy was not, in any way, restricted to Muslims. It encompassed all, Muslims and non-Muslims, humans &amp; the Jinn, &amp; even animals &amp; non-living things.</i><br /><br /><i>He (peace and blessings upon him) even showed mercy to those who wronged him or </i><b><i>attempted to kill HIM.</i></b><br /><br /><i>REHMAT ul AALMEEIN ﷺ</i><br /><br /><b>Some Hadiths on How to Deal With Non-Muslims in Your Life</b><br /><br />_Hazart Asma’ bint Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with her) said:<br />“My mother came to me while she was still a polytheist (مشرک), so I asked the Messenger of Allah, ‘My mother, has come to visit me and she is hoping for (my favor). Shall I maintain good relations with her?’<br /><br />He (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, ‘Yes, maintain good relations with your mother’”<br /><b>(Al- Bukhari and Muslim)</b><br /><br /><b>Is your non-Muslim family hostile? Pray for them</b><br />Narrated by Hazart Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him):<br /><br />At-Tufail ibn `Amr came to the Prophet and said, ‘The Daws (tribe) have perished as they disobeyed and refused to accept Islam. So invoke Allah against them.’<br /><br />But the Prophet said, ‘O Allah! Give guidance to the [the tribe of] Daws and bring them [as Muslims]!’”_<br /><b>(Al-Bukhari)</b><br /><br /><b>Receiving gifts from non-Muslims</b><br />The Prophet (peace and blessings upon him) accepted gifts from non-Muslims too.<br /><br /><b>Al-Bukhari narrated</b> that a Jewish woman brought him a sheep which was proved later to be poisoned after he ate some of it. The Prophet pardoned her.<br /><br />However, later on, when Bishr ibn Al-Bara’, who had also eaten from it, died, the Jewish woman was killed for him.<br /><br /><b>Visit the sick -Muslim or Non Muslim</b><br />Narrated by Anas:<br /><br />“A young <b>Jewish boy</b> used to serve the Prophet and he became sick. So the Prophet went to visit him. He sat near his head and asked him to embrace Islam. The boy looked at his father, who was sitting there. The latter told him to obey the Prophet and the boy embraced Islam.<br /><br />The Prophet came out saying:<br /><br /><b>“Praise be to Allah Who saved the boy from the Hell-fire” (Al-Bukhari)</b><br /><br /><b>Doing business with non-Muslims? Why not?</b><br /><br />The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to do business and enter into dealings with non-Muslims. It was narrated that `Hazart Aammii Sayeda Ayesha ta Siddiqa (may Allah be pleased with her) said:<br /><br />“The Messenger of Allah bought some food on credit from a Jew, and he gave him a shield of his as collateral (rahn)” <br /><b>(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</b><br /><br /><b>Respect for deceased persons</b><br /><br />Hazart Jabir ibn Hayyan said:<br /><br />“The last Prophet and his Companions stood up for the funeral of a Jew until it disappeared” <br /><b>(Sunan An-Nasa’i).</b><br /><br /><b>Just spread love 💗</b><br /><i>don&#39;t judge anybody&#39;s religion just by few bad people bcoz as five fingers are not equal as all people are not equal.</i><br /><b>Islam is a religion of Peace &amp; complete code of life.</b><br /><i>If you wanna see the real face of Islam than you should read the biography of our role model last Prophet Muhammad Mustafa صلی علی وآلہ وسلم peace be upon him than go on Prophets of Islam, than Companion of Last Prophet than Ahle e Bait (family members of last holy prophet&#39;) than Saints of Auliyaaye-e-Kiraam</i><br /><br /><b>STAY BLESSED TO ALL</b><br /><br /><br /><i>YOURWELLWISHER - DUAGO</i><br /><b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sufisindhiii"">#SufiSindhiii</a></b><b>🇵🇰, </b><b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23huqmujood"">#HuqMujood</a></b><b>🙏🏻</b><br /><b>Mohammad Asif Ali Nangraj</b><br />Subscribe on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ytc"">#YTc</a> 👉 <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gd__PRhmF7A"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gd__PRhmF7A</a>",Jeay Latif Jeay Sindh SufiSindhiii,2020-12-30T11:18:53Z,1

"You must do it yourself, nobody else can do it for you. Jesus gave us all the help we need for that. It is in <br />His perfect teachings, in His Gospel, and this is the New Testament. As human beings we are faced with <br />two different kinds of death. The first one is the physical death where everyone heads to the cemetery. <br />The second death is the spiritual death where we kill each other because of sin, Romans 6:23. Sin <br />produces death. So we must overcome our sins in order to be free from our spiritual death. This is why <br />God does not permit sin and also why Jesus commands us to be holy in 1 Peter 1:16, “Be holy for I am <br />Holy.” Being holy means we overcome our sins. The teachings of Christ help us to overcome all sins. This <br />is the wisdom of God, Mark 1:14-15. Overcoming sins is a perfect religion. Do we have this religion? This <br />is God’s religion, our holy God, the perfect God, and His holy kingdom. Are you holy? If you are not, this is <br />a serious mistake! Holiness equals perfection. You call yourself a Catholic? Do you overcome your sins? If <br />you don’t, you are a spectator. Do you call yourself an Orthodox? If you do not overcome your sins, then <br />you are a hypocrite. Do you call yourself a Protestant? Do you overcome your sins? If you don’t, you are <br />blind. Call yourself whatever you want, but do you overcome your sins? If you don’t, you walk with your <br />death because sin will kill you sooner or later, Romans 6:23, “The wages of sin is death.” Do you disobey <br />God? Do you continue to sin? This is the devil’s religion. God will put “the devil in hell to burn forever and <br />ever,” Revelation 20:10. If you continue to do the same that the devil does, you will be the next one to go <br />to hell. Sin will never enter into the holy kingdom of God! You must always stay holy, and this is God’s <br />plan. This is the eternal safety of His kingdom. So friend, do not let anyone fool you. Jesus said, “You must <br />truly repent and overcome your sins,” Mark 1:15. If you don’t, it will be the biggest mistake you ever <br />made. God through Jesus gave you grace to repent and to change. If you do not accept it, the grace cannot <br />do anything for you! There is no grace that permits you to disobey God. Do you understand? If God <br />permits disobedience and sin, then His kingdom will perish, including us. We do have an all-wise God <br />with a perfect knowledge, a perfect life, and a perfect kingdom. Nobody is permitted to destroy it! Sin <br />does not fit there. Remember, there is no sin in Jesus’ faith, and this is the faith we must follow, no one <br />else. So take sin out of your brain to be able to fit there. There is no sin when we obey God. Sin starts from <br />disobedience to God, and He does not permit that! So we cannot disobey God. Here is the proof: When <br />Adam and Eve disobeyed God, He kicked them out of paradise. Do you see that? Do you see any grace <br />there? Does God change? Religion or no religion, God does not permit disobedience, and He proved it <br />many times. Get to the Word of God so you can see for yourself. Grace or no grace, God does not permit <br />sin. Disobedience separates us from God, and sin produces death, even your own death. This is what you <br />want? God wants to protect us. We must learn His wisdom, not mankind’s insanity. That’s why Jesus said <br />to the devil, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God,” <br />Matthew 4:4. Have you ever read that? It says every word that comes from God’s wisdom, not mine not <br />yours. So my friend, get to the wisdom of God, this is your life. The Gospel of Christ is the wisdom of God. <br />Start reading it every day, and do what Jesus tells you to do. He is the only True, Savior for the whole <br />world and for you. If you obey Jesus totally, then I will see you in heaven for sure, see Matthew 7:21. Jesus <br />gave a command, “If you stay in my Word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,” John <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=8m32s"">8:32</a>. Jesus wants to help you, personally. Ask Him. He promised here, “If the Son delivers you, you will be <br />delivered for sure,” John 8:36. So what religion is going to deliver you? His name is Jesus Christ, Our <br />Savior. “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith,” Hebrews 12:2. Amen. <br />Niko Man of God Sent by Christ to evangelize the whole world. <br />Email: etwcministry@<a href=""http://outlook.com/"">outlook.com</a> YOUTUBE: CLEVELAND STREET PREACHERS,,,",violinmaestro knight,2020-12-11T23:22:49Z,0

"⭐JESUS IS COMING VERY VERY VERY SOON!🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺 <br />The return of Jesus is at hand!<br /> JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN!<br /><br />📖 John 14:6 says,<br /> &quot; Jesus says,  &#39;I AM THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES UNTO THE FATHER (in Heaven) BUT BY ME&#39;.<br /><br /> JESUS CHRIST is the only, true way to Salvation! It’s the free gift of GOD to all those who believe and trust Him! <br /><br />SALVATION! is the redemption of one’s soul from eternal destruction after death of man, on this earth, by the cleansing of the blood, and by the death and power of resurrection of Jesus Christ<br /><br />📖Acts.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=4m12s"">4:12</a> says.<br />Salvation is found in no one else (except Jesus Christ), for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.&quot;<br /><br />How is SALVATION gifted to man?<br />For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.<br /><br />📖John 3:3 says,<br />Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be Born Again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br /><br />How can a man be BORN-AGAIN?<br /><br />To be Born-Again in spiritual sense, is to die to our old sinful nature and be born-again in the spirit, to be holy, righteous with a new nature in Christ Jesus. <br /><br />👉To be born-again, we need to repent &amp; confess our sinful past for a holy future.<br /><br />What is repentance?<br />👉 REPENTANCE! Everyone born into this world is a Born-sinner. Human nature is a sinful nature. Sin in us has defiled us and has separated us from the Holy God! <br />We have to repent for all the unholy, lawless transgressions of God’s commandments done willfully or unknowingly, in order to obtain mercy and grace so that we might not be judged and fall into condemnation, the condemnation of eternal hell.<br /><br />📖 Acts.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=3m19s"">3:19</a> says,..✔️Repent, then, and turn to GOD, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the LORD<br /><br />What is confession of sins?<br /><br />👉 CONFESSION! The guilt of sin and it’s condemnation is rolled away if one truly regrets his sinful past and confesses them in the presence of Jesus Christ.<br />📖Romans.10:9 &amp;10<br />✔️That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.<br /><br /> 📖  1 John, 1st chapter &amp; verse 9 says..<br />✔️If we confess our sins, He (Jesus Christ) is faithful and just to forgive us our sins(every sin)...<br /><br />The sole purpose of sending Jesus Christ into this world more than 2020 ago is this👇<br /> 📖John.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a>-17 says &quot;<br /> 👉 GOD so loved the world (us) that He  (Father GOD) gave His only begotten Son to die for us ( our redemption ), that whosoever believes in Him (Jesus) should not perish (in hell) but have everlasting life.<br /> 👉 GOD has not sent His Son to condemn the world (us), but the world (we) through Him (Jesus Christ) might be saved.<br />⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩⏩<br /><br />Dear Bro/Sis.🙏🏼, You may be of any race, religion or creed. Rich or poor. White or black or brown. You may be the least sinner or the worst sinner on earth. You may leading the worst of immoral life against the principles of the Almighty GOD. God is concerned about your future and not your past. All He asks you is to repent and confess your sins to obtain mercy and have a secured and a blessed hope!<br /><br />📖 Hebrews.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=10m17s"">10:17</a><br />And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖<br /><br />If you say this small prayer with faith…👇<br /><br />“ LORD JESUS, I am a sinner, I have committed so many sins knowingly and unknowingly. Have mercy on me. Please forgive my every sin with your precious, Holy blood shed on the cross to save me. I believe you died on the cross, you were buried and rose again the third day for my justification. I believe you are the Almighty GOD!<br /><br />Accept me as your child. Help me to lead a holy life. Fill my heart with joy, give me heart to seek you.<br /><br />In Jesus precious name, I ask and believe. Amen!🙏🏼<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖<br />👆<br />If you have said this prayer, I can assuredly tell you that you are a new creation. You are Born-Again in the spirit through the righteousness of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />📖  2 Corinthians 5:17<br />“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”<br /><br /> 👉  Be Holy as the LORD your GOD is Holy!<br /><br />⏩FORSAKE SIN!<br />📖Proverbs.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=28m13s"">28:13</a> says..✔️He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.<br />👉📖Mark.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=16m16s"">16:16</a><br />He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not 📌shall be condemned <br /><br /> ⏩Read the Bible 📖⏩Know the Truth⏩Go to a Christ centered Church⏩Be Baptized⏩Be Blessed!<br /><br />⏩May the Holy Spirit GOD lead you &amp; guide you!🙏🏼<br /><br />👉 Be prepared for the RAPTURE!

"FYI, you HAVE to cycle those goats out to other people..<br /><br />I was raised with goats as a kid and we didn&#39;t do that for a couple generations. We ended up with one goat that was a hermaphrodite. It had both parts. My dad couldn&#39;t understand. My mom had to explain to him that he had several generations of inbreeding going on. He was a little tipsy and couldn&#39;t get it. He&#39;s like ah hell they&#39;re just goats not like people. She said &quot;look, your little family tree out there ain&#39;t forking, you understand now?&quot; 😂<br /><br />After that, what really convinced him, was this one goat we had. Its body was normal, but the face..<br /><br />The snout area became shorter than normal, and goats sometimes have a fur pattern. This one had a certain pattern that went around the eyes and gave the impression that it looked like a man. Once my sister pointed it out to him, he got freaked out. The face actually looked like a cross between a person and goat. 90% goat of course, but a few subtle things here and there that you could definitely tell.<br /><br />EVEN family and friends that would come by would mention it here and there. &quot;damn goat is looking kinda weird man&quot; 😂<br /><br />After he sold some off and did a fair trade, things became normal again. But it is very strange. Not to mention the health. Had to call the veterinarian quite alot..",Davie Dood,2020-11-09T11:40:35Z,0

"Billion Dollar Income Potential in Ruvol<br /><br />I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  <br /><br />Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” <br /><br />Why am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master the moves to a point they can even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is exactly for this reason I invented a game where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play. Ruvol, played somewhat like chess, requires more tactical skills than chess.<br /><br />The “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol is just mind-boggling!  <br /><br />In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These are all potential buyers of Ruvol, eager to see how it compares to chess.  At an average profit of just US$5 per set, the “Global Income Potential” for the owner then is a whopping US$4 billion.  <br /><br />I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  <br /><br />If you are interested to buy my copyright, don’t hesitate to give me your BEST PRICE OFFER.  Or if you know someone who might be interested, refer them to me; if they buy, you get a 10% commission.<br /><br />“Early bird catches the worm.”<br /><br />Thanks and God bless.<br /> <br />RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL<br />The Ruvol Inventor<br /><br />rodolfovitangcol@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>",The Attitudinalist,2020-10-17T12:19:47Z,0

What I observed when interacting with Bedouin families in Kuwait.  When women have to work outside you can&#39; stick them in a Burqa-chadari and expect to get the work done.  Bedou women receive more respect than in the  urban environment of the Arab world.  They are so kind and friendly and the love between family members is obvious.,Celt Jade,2020-10-15T01:23:11Z,0

@Mau kontol konek approximately 30% of Omanis are of Balochi descent which means that they probably migrated from Balochistan to Oman. Ethnic Arabs still make up the majority of Oman though.,Gab Wiharja Tjoanda,2020-10-03T07:28:28Z,0

"Eva I enjoyed this so much, I currently live in New York and I am now a mother of 5 children ages 10-22 but at one time I was a little dessert nomad child. I used to caravan with my Great Aunt Marrila, and my Great Uncle Warren and my Great Grandmother. It was the best years of my young life. Eventually they got too old and passed away, luckily I was pretty old then around 12-12 so I was able to fend for myself, but my heart yearns for this life again. It is something that I can not even properly describe for my children my past nomadic life , they have only known the comforts and buzz of America and NYC at that. I thank you truly for this gift of memories.",enchanted stream,2020-07-11T11:45:17Z,102

Having read the “Seven Pillars of Wisdom”, a few times and not having been yet able to visit such places, I found the experience of watching your experience, quite sad. The male culture seems to have adopted to modern luxury, but left the women behind 100+ years. Bedouin were once nomadic, their water source wells around the desert. Historically, the food in reference to the book, seems to have changed little. Marvellous. Thank you.",Andrew Vezey,2020-07-09T05:07:23Z,0

Perhaps the viewer would have discovered a little more of our lives. May be this is purely showing the day to day from a distance which is fine, like other documentaries but I would have really liked to understand more of the women and their lives.

"It’s a dream of mine to live in a dessert just to experience what my ancestors and almost all of our prophets had went through. Well, I’m lucky I’m born  and raised in Uae (but my blood or basically myDNA  is Yemen) I didn’t really like what I got from this modern world, and I wanted to live life as if I was back in the 600’s. Just a simple life filled with freedom and no “human” laws, but only following what God had told us not to do and what to do. I would love the warmth of the sand and the natural cold air I’m getting every night, the clean environment and far away from the crowed too. Hopefully when I turn 18 I get to live with a family in Uae who lives in a dessert to know what I should do.<br /><br /><br />If you see this and it’s written on the top 4 years ago, check my channel.",crabberry café,2020-06-30T19:22:05Z,8

Oman is on my radar to visit as soon I retire and free in about a year. I was wondering if you can answer this. I have noticed that for the last decade are so due to weather pattern changes Oman has been affected by Hurricanes many times. You did notice a boat in the middle of the desert when you were driving. My guess is it was probably  dropped there by one the hurricane’s intense winds.  My questions is what do these Bedouin families  do to protect themselves and their livestock during hurricane .

"I can feel the happiness of the family even with this short video. I feel so envious of them. They may have a basic life but they have enough, enough food, water supply etc. Don&#39;t ever call them poor. Look at the numbers of goats and camels they have. They are certainly rich at heart and very happy with their life. I am so happy I watched this video. Love - sara foo",Sara Foo,2020-06-01T17:55:00Z,610
"@Sara Foo yep that&#39;s true. It&#39;s not harmful but it will reduce pleasure a bit. But men also have reduced pleasure with the removal of the foreskin and nobody cares about that, so I don&#39;t see it as a problem",Starie Hearts,2021-04-19T04:38:07Z,0
"@Iori kasanuga Thank for sharing your thoughts and experience in Oman. Im living in Malaysia and I have many Muslim friends too. They never complained about this practice and never did I hear about the complications due to this practice. I also think what is being practiced here is the same in Oman, the doctor will perform a tiny slit on the prepuce and there is no such thing as cutting the clitoris or labia. I don&#39;t know that it enhances sexual pleasure because I have been told that it is the opposite.",Sara Foo,2021-02-25T19:09:31Z,0
"i lived in Omani villages few years back..i saw what they practice is they cut a tiny bit of tissue around the clitoris to make it more exposed..not cutting the clitoris completely/or labia minora for that matter..it&#39;s just the clitoral hood they cut..it is not practiced by all Omanis, and it is not prescribed in islam..it is some local practice done by some families..yes there is risk of causing more injury and infection(though they uses new blade that is sterilised with fire)..but in general they never need to come to hospital for any bleeding/infection issues..contrary to what you are protraying,that the purpose is to devoid the girls of any sexual pleasure..i think it is actually done to enhance their ability to feel the pleasure..i worked as a g.p. (foreigner,not Omani) in those deserts for 6 years",Iori kasanuga,2021-02-13T06:28:01Z,1

"@shula may Salam sister, thank you very much for your concern for us and our safety, you are beautiful person, I agree that fear for your safety is a form of oppression not what the muslim men impose on us necessarily but by men in general, I remember the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo"">#metoo</a> movement in the west and all over the world  and see how much the wisdom of my religion with regards to the distancing between men and women and lessening unnecessary interaction that would lead to opression of women (like sexual harrassment) as is exemplified by the metoo movement were women become helpless and at the mercy of indecent men and forced to be silenced in many cases because of being shamed by their own society (which I really sympathize with and I pray for all those women healing and strength), for us muslim women we see these things as THE oppression of men. Fortunately, our religion empowers us by telling us a way to avoid these unfortunate happenings cause if we are physically distant from men, they would have less chances of doing physical harm such as sexual harrassment. I live in a secular country which is dominated by the Christian faith (Philippines P. S I love our Christian brothers and sisters) by the way and I still impose this segraegation/distancing on myself whenever possible because the lust and indecency of men trancend religion, race and country. I pray and hope that oppression of women by men all over the world would end and women would be TRULY empowered to battle these oppressions.",Irshada Hasan,2020-07-11T22:17:32Z,0
"@Irshada Hasan <br />That is very sad, and of course I understand that the more dangerous men are to women in your society, you would feel less comfortable socializing with them, but that IS opression. When you are restricted in your behaviour because you fear for your safety, that is opression.<br /> It happenes everywhere, of course, but some places are safer for women then others.. I don&#39;t feel as threatened where I live and with the kinds of people I hang out with in comparison to the state of fear that you&#39;re describing.",shula may,2020-07-11T18:34:09Z,2

Gulf countries have the best facilities infrastructure and standard of living.  Still I don&#39;t understand how the Bedouin for no reason can opt for such a difficult life style.<br />People who are liking this life style is good to see in video but for any of us it will be too difficult especially in summer.<br />Bedouin s can get facilities from the government if they want to move any small town if they are not use to city life but still they choose desert life.<br />It makes me confused,Khan,2020-05-02T07:00:48Z,0

"Islamophobics say that our beloved Prophet (SAW) made Islam so he could indulge in wealth and abundance in his life and do as he pleases when infact even as a governor of Medina he and as great ruler with so many followers he lived his life like this simple and even more so less than what they the Bedouin family have. As long as he could have a roof to sleep on, and a food he could eat. Even as the Prophet (SAW) only had a little of wealth and food he would still give to the poor and those in need and take care of guest when they visit. For he knows God rewards those who do good.",That kid on the block,2020-04-27T08:02:47Z,2

"Cheers from Saudi Arabia.<br />I love your video and thanks for conveying this priceless message of how our ancestors used to live and survive.<br />Bedouins are becoming very rare. They were born Bedouins and will die with their own style of living.<br /><br />That bread you had is called: Malla bread. It&#39;s pronounced in Arabic as: Khubz Malla. It&#39;s very tasty because of it&#39;s smoky flavor. You can dip it in honey, stew of your choice, cheese or just have it plain with some tea and you&#39;ll never have enough with it. It&#39;s just a simple dough made of flour, water, 2-3 tbl spn cooking oil and a sprinkle of salt. Dig a small hole on a sandy ground, and set fire with coal. I&#39;ll write a title of the method of preparation (in Arabic) so you can (copy and paste) and search youtube for it (it&#39;s self explanatory) :<br />طريقة خبز الملة<br /><br />And yeah, Bedouins are known for their hospitality, generosity (they offer what they have even though they are not wealthy) and known for their kindness.They are genuine people by nature, humble, no hatred, no discrimination, no fancy brands, no McDonald&#39;s (lol) and just love to live their life peacefully.",Ahmad,2020-04-13T20:21:22Z,118

"Not as harsh as it would have been if they hadn&#39;t a vehicle to tranport them around, or a generator to extract water from the well, or a stove to cook food and food stocks that comes from a city not depending solely on their camels and goats for food! Oh, and a TV and satellite dish for intertainment, lol.  Surely, its a comfort life in the middle of the desert for a typical Bedouin life. I feel the interference of modern life has changed the organic way of life for the survival of Bedouins in the desert or how it used to be in the old days. I was wondering if these little girls go to school? They seem very sharp, especially the little one, Hayat :)",Diane K,2020-03-14T09:46:21Z,1

Sharing a plate a food with people who wipe their ass with their bare hands is not a good idea. Also that extra room for the women to be in is because they are made to be there cause they have no rights at all. They have to wear the hijab too or they will get a beating.Different  Cultures suck sometimes,Joe Alamillo,2020-03-14T03:08:06Z,0

"@Black Saint Most Bedouins do not like hospitals and give birth in the Badia in the Badia of Yemen and the borders of Oman and some of them live without education only in the Badia and most of them leave fathers and mothers in the Badia and study their children and go Badia in the holidays and few remain in the Badia and cut off from civilization and education and  Their heart is thinking about educating their children, but they do not leave the desert because it is the place where you escape from the pressures and diseases of modern life, and live like a free hawk without unfair laws and a prison between four walls",Abboud Almenhali,2020-05-27T05:44:17Z,2

Your such an inspiration for my dream to become a blogger as well. While watching your story with the Bedouin family, I was able to gather some strength and ideas for myself as well on the positivity side of life. And that little girl is such a cutie, and you two are meant to establish a lifelong bond together. She will always remember you for the rest of her life. You seem like a great sister to that little girl. I have seen so many bloggers all over, but your expressions are so different in terms of being so brilliant in your work.

they are there for fun not for living <br />my parents was bedouin. the bedouin live in valleys and grass lands,ali ali,2020-02-05T16:20:17Z,0
@ali ali <br />It is clear that they live in this area because of that precious source  of water since they buy food for animals as we saw in the video. It seems that water is very expensive in that part of the world. The family cultivates animals (camels and goats) to sell in the market. It is their source of income.,al Dallika,2020-02-06T06:04:58Z,0
al Dallika <br />the source of water and the source of food for the animals,ali ali,2020-02-06T05:50:24Z,0
"@ali ali <br />In fact, they are not Bedouin since they do not travel. To be a Bedouin you have to carry your tents and move from one place to another looking for water and grass. I think this family is a part of a tribe that lives in the same area and share the same source of water. And because the area is safe so there is no need to construct their houses close to each other . Just think about their source of water. I do not believe they own it. It was there for long time",al Dallika,2020-02-06T05:28:39Z,0
al Dallika <br />no family live without neighbors. bedouin do not live in sand sea they live in grassland or semi-desert land,ali ali,2020-02-06T04:45:04Z,0
They have a lot of animals which means they live there. It is their home,al Dallika,2020-02-06T03:02:04Z,0

So believe in God and His messengers and do not speak of a ‘Trinity’- stop [this], that is better for you- God is only one God, He is far above having a son, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him and He is the best one to trust.&quot;",Faizan Khan,2020-01-08T20:31:41Z,1

First time I saw a nomadic family eshtablishment in the desert. Thanks for sharing their lives beautifully. It would have been more interesting if few things were answered related to their lives. Why the herd of livestock kept so far away from their place? Why not residing near the water well? Why they have choosen a life like this since many of them moved out to the modern (populated) world? I mean these are few questions appear when someone views the video and by doing this you can make us understand their lives better.,Ashish Poddar,2020-01-04T05:11:20Z,0

"@John Galt don&#39;t blame you honestly....... going off topic people think being born in eastern countries life is hard and women and children have no rights thats the reason people think its the religion but Islam teaches us to be kind to love your fellow neighbour&#39;s to not fight the innocents. Our prophet said a white man has not superiority over a black man and a black man has no superiority over a white man and that a arab has no superiority over a non-arab and a non-arab has no superiority over a arab. If you knew the rights the women of Islam has you would be surprised. One person asked the prophet Mohammed PBUH &quot;who comes after God&quot; the prophet replied &quot;Your Mother&quot; then the person asked &quot;next&quot; the prophet replied &quot; your mother &quot;2x   the prophet replied 3 times for mother then father as last once....so its God, mother, mother, mother and father.",Shaheryar Ahmed,2020-01-01T23:14:50Z,0

"@MARTIN HAMILTON quite the contrary , gatherings are segregated because in that part of the world men and women are vastly different. Men speak in a very topic oriented manner and may discuss a single point or topic for a prolonged period of time in great detail and from many aspects. Women on the other hand discuss a variety of topics less extensively. Those two put together serve the unity of man and woman, one being precise and accurate, and the other covering more diverse ground. But at the same time their meetings cannot be held together otherwise none of them can achieve their conversational role and would cause men to either be more womanized in their thinking or women to get very quickly bored from the consistency of the conversation of men.

Was there any reason that you didn&#39;t show the locations of toileting and bathing? (Not necessarily in great detail, but just a glimpse, perhaps!)<br /><br />2. What were the men doing during this time?

"that’s amazing experience. how do you go by getting to do that kind of thing?<br />Seeing how they flourish in an environment like that, makes me feel I can live just about anywhere.",Fra Dee,2019-12-22T08:28:21Z,0
"@Fra Dee Let me share a different perspective with you.  It is actually you who are in a 100x&#39;s more danger than I.  Living in the city is a virtual, literal prison.  You are at the mercy of people and companies over which you have no control whatsoever.  People in cities are no longer safe to leave their homes. People are getting shot in Walmart, in schools, at the workplace. It is no wonder people are anxious and experience paranoia on a 24 hour basis.  Eventually this shows up in the physical health as well does it not?  A body can only sustain so much emotional strain before it begins to break down.<br /><br />I can store large amounts of water, can a person in the city do that?  Can a person in the city store large amounts of food or have the ability to grow more if there should be a shortage of food?  I can store petrol and I do.  I have a pony and cart, I can get to a lot of places should the petrol run out.  If my electricity goes out, I have solar - a frig, a freezer, an evaporative cooler.  I have over 20 canopies with 90% shade cloth, so even if I was to have to ration water, I would still have a nice place under my fruit trees, that are under canopies.....to spend my summer days.  I have goats, ducks.....they provide enough food along with the fruit and vegetables that I can live a fairly normal life no matter what happens.  You might want to read up on air to water production.....we can do that on vast scales here in rural areas?  Can people in the city do this......they can not do this even in normal times.....what would happen if there was a long term situation?<br /><br />I think also you are not familiar with different kinds of desert.  We are not Las Vegas - LOL, that is lower desert which has higher temperatures and sparse vegetation.  You should see the Higher Desert in spring.  You cannot see the ground because it is covered with wild flowers.  I keep bees also.  I will never be too hot or too cold here even if everything should fail in the system. All of my trees, everything I grow, are in pots and all trees are dwarfed so they take very little water to grow.<br /><br />You just have become used to the prison and have developed an insensitivity to the danger.  And it is not paranoia to use common sense.  You should have food, water, tools, a makeshift solar oven, blankets and clothing in your car at all times.  That is just smart.  I lived in the wilderness for 20 years by myself, you just learn to be smart so that should anything happen, you are prepared.<br /><br />Here is a link to my blog should you like to further talk.  <a href=""https://expressionsoftheheartfarm.blogspot.com/2019/12/and-here-we-go.html"">https://expressionsoftheheartfarm.blogspot.com/2019/12/and-here-we-go.html</a>.  The Bedouins are not afraid of the desert, they have learned to work with Nature, they are actually safer than you - LOL.",Elementaldomain,2020-01-01T15:20:02Z,1
"@Elementaldomain sounds pretty good. I&#39;d probably carry 5 gallons of water in my car if I ever lived there, just in case my car breaks down. Do you store water, in case something weird goes down and your grid water supply is cut off? I drove with a lot of water during my drive to Las Vegas, last summer. Paranoia. <br /><br />It&#39;s amazing how you can grow that many fruit/nut trees. I live in the bay area, growing several fruit trees myself. I&#39;d grow more, but out of space in my townhouse yard. Nextdoor neighbors are literally stuck to us. We share the same walls. Never enough parking spaces.<br /> I&#39;ve resorted to planting in public parks, but occasionally the gardeners chop down my plants. How dare they. I like to grow root vegetables... potatoes, sunchokes, etc. in these public areas.<br /><br />You have any pics of your property? <br />I take it back that I wouldn&#39;t live in the desert,  but I would store so much water.",Fra Dee,2020-01-01T03:38:47Z,0
"@Fra Dee About 30 minutes out of Yucca Valley, which is at 3400&#39; above Palm Springs.  Water has never been an issue here.  It came as a huge surprise when a good deal of Northern California, especially those beautiful scenic areas like the Joaquin Valley, Porterville, etc, ran out of water.  But in retrospect it should not have come as a surprise.  The farmers up that way acted like they would never run out of water and acted accordingly, growing crops like almonds which is unwise.<br /><br />I have about 50 fruit and nut trees, and grow hydroponic seasonal crops.  The weather here is optimal for growing and it is very rural so not a lot of neighbors, which is nice because I don&#39;t have to worry about people growing GMO crops or using deadly pesticides.  We get winters with a normal high around 50-60 during the day and summers are usually around 95.<br /><br />Yes, it was very affordable but is becoming less so.  I paid $6,000 for 2-1/2 acres.  My taxes are $250 a year.  With the temperate weather in the winter and I have sun facing windows in the cabin, I never need supplemental heat.  Summers are great too, only having to use evaporative coolers.<br /><br />We get more water here per user than anyone else in California. We get our water from the same sources as L.A. does but we have fewer people.  I see water becoming a big issue for every one else but us.  We get quite a bit of snow here in the winter too, we just got 12&quot; last week.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-31T23:53:47Z,1
"@Elementaldomain where do you get water to farm in the California desert? I too live in Cali, but that&#39;s the only area I wouldn&#39;t move to. I don&#39;t like the lack of naturally occurring water sources for long term occupancy. Acreage in the area is pretty affordable, that&#39;s one benefit.",Fra Dee,2019-12-31T22:33:07Z,0
"You can.  Its a matter of mind set, of consciousness.  It takes a person who always sees the glass as half full, not half empty.  Only self-starters, self-disciplined people can live this way of life.  I am a single woman farmer living in the High Desert of California. I have electricity, but also solar.  I do not have any big, electricity hogging appliances. I wouldn&#39;t live any other way. My life is Happy, Peace-Full and fairly slow moving.  My shower is outside inside a small greenhouse, even on a winter day, its 70 in there. I have time to watch the sunset. I couldn&#39;t ask for anything more. The first decision is what can you tolerate, and what can you not? I do not like humidity, or lots of bugs swarming around.....so I choose desert instead of tropical or the South of the U.S.  I do  not like cold, so I do not live in Minnesota.  That is the most important decision, every thing else comes easy.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T17:50:52Z,1

"It is no more difficult to live there than anywhere. Everywhere has plus and minuses. Really, all in all, they have a very good life.  They have all their needs and necessities met, what more do they need?  They don&#39;t work 60 hours a week or have to work to pay a mortgage. No one is going to kick them out if they can&#39;t pay the rent or the mortgage. They have food. Meat, milk. Will you if there is a nature cataclysm...no drinkable water, no food, no electricity? Every geographical region has good weather and bad weather.  I live in the desert.....there are a lot more pluses than minuses.  City people are living lives of fantasy.

"I can&#39;t help but notice how she said she&#39;s going into the wild and unknown and far from all the comforts of modern living, without electricity and running water? And right the next minute, she&#39;s showing us around the house which is more luxurious than mine, with satellite TV and nicely segregated living quarters. Besides they just drove an hour from the city and reached their wildly secluded destination. I bet I could walk back into the city in just under a day. I was hoping for a more rudimentary and more authentic experience into the unknown? Much respect for the Bedouin family roughing it out in the desert but this was not what I expected. They live like just on the outskirts of town, with many modern amenities, with satellite TV, with state of the art solar panels system, with generators to source water, lots of livestock and land cruisers lying about their more than adequately insulated tent houses?

"For most of us &quot;The people of the cities&quot; we sometimes ask: Why would someone live like this, in the middle of nowhere, when they can actually live much easier life?, little that we know, that they are living the life they know and used to, and they wouldn&#39;t trade it for what &quot;we&quot; have.<br /><br />I find it hard to live in the desert like they do, even though I am an Arab from the gulf. And yes, some tribes in the gulf countries still live like this in 2019, but for the &quot;Outsiders&quot; it is not really possible as we are used to stuff like electricity, internet, video games, the locked doors at night, ...etc.<br /><br />This video is so amazing, and I thank you Eva for making it.

Some people are probably wondering why they didn&#39;t build brick and mortar house since they almost have everything else. Well these are pastoralist people. They move around meaning permanent structures are not part of the life style.<br /><br />Where I&#39;m from (eastern parts of Ethiopia called Somali Region), it&#39;s not a desert. <br /><br />Omanis are wonderful people with rich history and culture. They once ruled many parts of Arabia and east Africa. Even in Somalia they came and played important role in Somali society.<br /><br />Much love",Hawd DDSI Ethio,2019-12-20T03:02:01Z,1

Loved the video and you have a wonderful personality...just the perfect person to make this documentary. It was professionally well done and the quality was outstanding. If you do not mind my comment (50+ years as professional photographer)....the video in the intro was somewhat shaky and not a stable as later videos. I would suggest that instead of a selfie stick (guessing that is what you are using) and switch to a gimbal it will give you steadier shots and in the video editor you can use the stabilization setting for steadier videos. Going to subscribe to your channel...keep up the good work.,Dennis Chapman,2019-12-19T07:26:59Z,1

So much to learn about how “advancements” has not advanced us at all. US children don’t smilr like this. They look scared and nervous. So sad. Thanks for sharing.,Z M,2019-12-19T00:40:52Z,0

You should visit libya next. Drew binksy visited a week ago and you should to.

"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=6m19s"">6:19</a> the modern formulation of the Kohel is not the same as the one used by Cleopatra. the following article describes the study that discovered this information while leaving out key portions of the study. the rest has been removed from web access. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By            Richard Alleyne, Science Correspondent<br /><br />3:55PM GMT 08 Jan 2010<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Researchers now believe that Egyptians applied the eyeliner 4,000 years ago in order to ward off infections. <br /><br /> Lead salts in the make-up helped to protect against eye disease, the French study claims. <br /><br /> The &quot;smokey eyes&quot; look favoured by ancient Egyptians such as Cleopatra is one of the most enduring in fashion. <br /><br /> But the researchers at the Louvre museum in Paris believe it was originally for medical reasons as much as aesthetics. <br /><br /> Their study, published in the journal Analytical Chemistry, suggests it helped to protect against eye disease. <br /><br /> The key appears to be lead salts contained in the make-up. <br /><br /> At very low levels, salts produce nitric oxide, which boosts the immune system to fight off bacteria which can cause eye infection. <br /><br /> The make-up used by the ancient Egyptians to darken and enhance the eyes sometimes took up to a month to concoct. <br /><br /> In theory, because it contained lead it might actually have posed a risk to health. <br /><br /> But an analysis by scientists led by Philippe Walter showed that at low doses it had a protective effect. <br /><br /> He said: &quot;We knew ancients Greeks and Romans too had noted the make-up had medicinal properties, but wanted to determine exactly how.&quot; <br /><br /> The researchers used a tiny electrode, a 10th of the thickness of a human hair, to look at the effect of lead chloride salt synthesised by the Egyptians – laurionite – on a single cell. <br /><br /> &quot;In stimulating non-specific immunological defences, one may argue that these lead compounds were deliberately manufactured and used in ancient Egyptian formulations to prevent and treat eye illnesses by promoting the action of immune cells,&quot; they said. <br /><br /> It is also thought that Galena, the natural mineral form of lead sulphite, was used as eye make up known as kohl and possesses antiseptic and fly-deterrent properties as well as protecting the eyes from intense sun.",darren marchant,2019-12-18T18:57:36Z,0

"Z M sorry I came across as what I didn’t mean. I meant was that in these stupid countries, so called Muslim countries, where Islam is supposed to be practised but instead tradition is practised. I don’t mind tradition if it doesn’t contradict or go against Islam. But what I am trying to say is that just because someone is Muslim it doesn’t mean they are following Islam, they could be following their tradition instead, so my point is that not to have that assumption. Because a lot of things get done under tradition which is not really morally correct but people think it’s what Islam teaches when in infact Islam is against it as well. <br /><br />You sound so ignorant here, NO, <br />NOT ALL WESTERN WOMEN GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO, ITS BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO. IT’S NOTHING TO DO WITH BILLS OR PAYING THEIR SHARE, it’s just that they want to use their brain more, not do jobs everyday that doesn’t require much of their brain power. Seriously, you sound like them non-Muslims who think all Muslim women are forced to wear hijab.<br /><br />I got many non-Muslim and Muslim friends where they go to work because they want to do something for themselves, NOTHING TO DO WITH PAYING FOR ANY EXPENSES OR ANY PRESSURE FROM HUSBANDS. Muslim women can work as long it’s within halal environment so please stop this lecture about women not working for someone else’s business. And yes, there are many jobs where I seen a Muslim woman is able to work in halal environment as long as she knows the boundaries and have to be less picky about which job she does.",Not Sure,2019-12-23T03:54:27Z,0
"@Not Sure No tradition doesn&#39;t take over religion for all. Maybe for some who choose to follow their traditions instead which should not be attributed to the religion then. I didn&#39;t see very hard labor. And this labor they do is for their own homes, not for some corporation or factory etc. <br />Women really don&#39;t CHOOSE to work in the west. I know I live here. And most women HAVE to work because in this way of life and mentality, women are responsible for their own maintenance and those of their families. So western women work 40 plus hours a week, have babies and only get 6 weeks off before having to go back to work, and then are expected to also pay bills and do the housework. This definitely should be criticized. It&#39;s unfair and its oppressive but few speak to this injustice and accept it. I don&#39;t. And as Muslims we are supposed to speak out against this, or what you called &quot;preaching&quot;. Most if not all the women I know would rather not HAVE to work but they are forced to because the western society especially in the US isn&#39;t supportive of families. Wages are low and housing costs are high, you pay for health care etc etc. SO the criticism is on the way of life in the US that oppresses families especially women and children. Yes I will continue to &quot;preach&quot;. Women need to know this is wrong so changes can be made. I would rather work for myself like these women, on my terms and within my control, then under corporate America. Been there done that. No thank you. I am grateful to accept Islam as my way of life that allows me with the blessing of my rights as a women being respected and honored. We don&#39;t live according to our &quot;tradition&quot;.",Z M,2019-12-22T14:14:02Z,0
"Z M I am a Muslim too. Stop with the lecture, tradition takes over religion, just because this is in a ISLAMIC country that doesn’t mean they follow everything of Islam. Most of these people follow their traditions over religion. I asked the question what do men do? I think some of these jobs these women are doing are very hard labour, therefore women should not be doing it. <br /><br />In the West women CHOOSE to work, they are not forced to. Whether a woman chooses to work or not work, it should not be criticised either way.",Not Sure,2019-12-20T17:11:12Z,0
Who do you think buys the food and all else?? Muslim men work outside of the home as well as around the home. Muslim women control the home. We don’t have to go out and earn a living. We take care of home. It’s sad western women are expected to be men and women. We don’t expect our men to be stay at home dad’s while we work.

Eva: there is no electricity <br />Also Eva: here is the TV and satellite,M. Ali G.,2019-12-16T08:46:07Z,13
"@Moon Striker I have an older TV like that, it uses 100W.  The propane cylinder is to the right, the orange tank.  Those kind of knobs on the stove are propane knobs as they ignite the igniter when they turn. FYI, an electric stove consumers at least 3000W with a 5000W+ surge.....not possible to have an electric stove out there, even with solar.  Well, it would take about an acre of solar panels for one big appliance.  Residential solar will not run big appliances like stoves and AC.  Propane stoves BTW, have their burners quite aways down inside the enclosure - mine is 4 inches.....its a safety precaution so that if for some reason the propane is on too long before the igniter strikes, it will not blow you up. You don&#39;t need big flames on a propane stove like a normal residential stove in a city, propane is hotter than natural gas.  <br /><br />If you will look at the storage shelf where the pots are, you can see that all the bottoms are black - electric stoves do not burn the bottom of a pan like that, only propane or natural gas.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T18:54:41Z,0
"@Elementaldomain Mr. NA edukashion: old TVs consume far more electricity than new ones. Old leds consumed as much as CRTs, 3-4 times more than new ones, ~150w for a small 28&#39;&#39;. They also seem to have an electric stove (she was cooking, no flames, no gas cylinder ).  &quot;It is always wise to actually know what you are talking about Dear&quot; lmao :)",Moon Striker,2019-12-26T18:05:49Z,0
"@Moon Striker It is always wise to actually know what you are talking about Dear.  First of all, they probably have a 100-200 watt solar setup, which includes batteries that hold a charge when the sun is not shining.  Its an OLD Tv, so it probably doesn&#39;t require more than 75 watts or so.  Their frig is most likely a propane frig.  I would imagine they use the TV for practical things like weather and news, not entertainment.  With a small solar setup like that, which isn&#39;t expensive, especially there, where solar is much cheaper than the U.S.....they could run the TV 1-2 hours a day.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T17:16:08Z,0

The place is in Oman, 2 hours from Muscat and  it&#39;s one of the largest underground caves which you have to absail down to. Now that would be an interesting vlogg if you gain access and fascinating to watch if you explored the stories about this place.

"First of all , all of humanity are from Africa , and Arabs are not an exception. <br /><br />not everyone that speaks Arabic is an Arab , as you know Arabic language is important in Islam that is why a lot of Muslims speak Arabic , but they are not Arabs.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br /><br />the Arabic tribes know their history and we are not decedent from modern Africans !<br />but sure there was relation with African people. <br /><br /><br /><br />Arabs started the oldest civilization in East Africa lock at this article.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%CA%BFmt"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%CA%BFmt</a>",Y.A,2019-12-17T12:49:54Z,0

@DANISH SULAIMAN also the climate is very hot its normal there to have 55c in August,ahmad mohammad,2019-12-17T02:31:29Z,1
@Joseph Sofaer Nope i&#39;ve done some research. Arabs are not black. Stop being afro centrist. Levantines people have genetic continuity since 10000 years ago. Bedouins have african genes bcoz they used to be host for the afro slaves,DANISH SULAIMAN,2019-12-16T19:18:33Z,3
"DANISH SULAIMAN The original (Bedouin) Arabs have quite a lot of African ancestry. The white Arabs that you see in the Levant and modern cities are heavily mixed with Iranians, Circassian and Caucasian groups.<br /><br />Even Arabic is classified as a an Afro-Asiatic language as it was spoken by African speakers originally.",Joseph Sofaer,2019-12-16T16:30:59Z,1
