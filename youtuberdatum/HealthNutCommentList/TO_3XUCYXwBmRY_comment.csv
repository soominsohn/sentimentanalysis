People have a genetic ability to how they taste celery. I actually don&#39;t find it different than tasting water or cucumber.,That Lady,2021-04-26T23:03:47Z,0
"This girl makes some big mistakes. You should cut the celery in SMALL parts. Like 0,5cm. Otherwhise you brake the juicer the celery strings will be to long and get stuck in the machine breaking it. Secondly DONT STORE CELERY JUICE. Make it fresh every morning for more reasons than i can mention here.",marcelw1981,2021-04-22T12:51:44Z,0

"Hey, I just read out about celery juice and it&#39;s benefits recently. You probably already have a juicer by now, but I wanted to let you know that if anything happens to your juicer you can cut it into small pieces and use a blender. and drain it in a nut bag or something similar. Medical medium says to not add anything to the juice because it will interfere with it. And freash juice is always better ir within 24 hrs. I also wanted to let you know that when you throw away the pulp, you&#39;re throwing away nutrients (mainly fiber) . I&#39;ve read you can freeze it, use it in recipes for smoothies, soups etc recipes<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve seen that people use it in baked goods I don&#39;t think I feel the need to do that though.",Jacob Michard,2020-04-22T04:34:12Z,0

"Love Anthony William, the Medical Medium.  I have all of his books:  Medical Medium, Life Changing Foods, Thyroid Healing, Liver Rescue and his latest Celery Juice.  I also have been following him for years.  He is the modern day Edgar Cayce.  He gets his information from Spirit, much the same as Cayce did but he gets it a little different than Cayce did.  He has helped heal thousands of people with various illnesses.  If you are looking for a new juicer, Anthony recommends the Omega Juicers.  This is the brand that I have and I highly recommend it also.  Canadian Tire has a sale on their juicers from time to time.  Also, for those who don&#39;t have or want to buy a juicer, Anthony recommends blending the celery in a high speed blender and then straining it through a nut milk bag or cheese cloth.  As far as the funky taste, Anthony says that the taste usually depends upon what kind of toxins the body is trying to remove and the taste usually gets better over time. Also, if you buy celery juice from a grocery store or health food store, make sure that it was freshly squeezed and not trucked in from somewhere else because it will  have been pasteurized (high pressure pasteurization) and will have no benefits because the pasteurization process kills off the enzymes.  Fresh is best.",Bon River,2019-08-22T02:50:22Z,0

Juicing a variety of of veggies with an apple or cucumber is great as a daily rutine. Is best to consume a wide variety of nutrients from all possible and available veggies. I think celery juice may be most beneficial for those who are seeking to cleanse their body and heal some condtion they may be dealing with.<br />Just an FYI, you can educate yourself on which juicer feets your needs best by watching John Kohler <a href=""http://discountjuicers.com/"">Discountjuicers.com</a> youtube channel. 👍<br />Keep up the good work <br />God bless you",G Vas,2019-08-22T02:01:33Z,2

Celery juice= extra hydration just that,Paola Rossy,2019-08-21T23:51:12Z,9
Celery is at the top of the “Dirty Dozen” list of produce that is most contaminated with pesticide residue. I would recommend always buying organic if you were drinking this juice for 30 days straight since it would be basically like drinking concentrated chemicals. Ingesting the pesticides would negate all the health benefits,Jen Maynard,2019-08-21T22:43:38Z,39
@Asherah 1147 Thanks for being smart. I think it is ironic that the Medical Medium warns us about copper but doesn&#39;t realize that he&#39;s now causing everyone to OD on copper potentially... make sure you take extra zinc I guess...,Civilization-Hoax Dot Com,2020-03-14T07:58:05Z,0
"I believe that organic produce still has pesticides. They’re natural. While traditional farmers can use up to 900 different pesticides. 95% of folks believe that organic means no pesticides. Not true. Their crops are vulnerable to the same critters as traditional farmland. Which means, fungicides and some 20 other approved organic pesticides. According to the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy, the two top organic fungicides are copper and sulfur. So it’s not if produce has pesticides, it’s what type. It’s origin. Organically derived or man made?",Asherah 1147,2020-02-28T00:04:07Z,2
Yes organic,Ariella Corey,2019-10-13T21:53:09Z,0
@Claudia Badia Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s from a farmers market or grocery store. Either way it can still have pesticides unless it&#39;s specifically labelled organic,Jen Maynard,2019-08-28T22:01:49Z,2
When I switched to organic celery I noticed it was MUCH better tasting! Thanks for the info.,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-08-22T20:21:03Z,7
I didn’t mind the taste.,TiMalice2009,2019-08-21T22:11:04Z,5
Do a video on your consult with the Medical Medium! 😁,TiMalice2009,2019-08-21T22:08:29Z,18
Lots of requests for this! I might have to 😊,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-08-22T20:21:26Z,2
I thought you’re supposed to drink the juices (and smoothies) immediately otherwise they lose their health properties.,Gigi,2019-08-21T22:08:16Z,2

"Interesting journey.. Very real.. Is it just plain lemon + water in the morning, or do you add anything else to it? I am on turmeric+lemon+pepper+water. Just wanted to know if there is anything other recipe that&#39;s more helpful.",Ruchi Agarwal,2019-08-21T22:04:09Z,1
I always drink celery juice when my stomach feels “off” (in the morning on empty stomach). It works really well to resolve issues. You don’t need THAT much juice at a time. I make half of a celery bunch at a time and it still works.  I tried diluting it with cucumbers but it doesn’t work as well to heal my issues as just plain celery.,Gigi,2019-08-21T22:00:45Z,12
"I occasionally add a stick of celery to my green smoothie, and there is usually enough other good stuff in there to conceal the taste. I just don&#39;t think its worth the taste and money to do a juice every day",Kristan Makl,2019-08-21T21:49:03Z,12

Am I the only one who remember you said in a previous video that you were drinking celery juice every morning?,Clarisse Chefdor,2019-08-21T21:45:33Z,9
I’ve done it on and off for years but not this long in a row. And when I’ve done it in the past I used organic right from the start because it wasn’t as expensive. Conventional celery juiced tastes soo much more bitter 😝I also would make it in my blender with water which makes it easier to drink and sometimes lemon. Juicing it through a juicer is sooo much stronger!,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-08-22T00:47:23Z,0
I tried it for a few weeks. I couldn’t continue with it. I felt like it was a lot of work and clean up. It also made my stomach feel worse for more than a couple of days. I am going to stick with smoothies.,Lisa Paxton,2019-08-21T21:37:00Z,9
What is the cost comparison between store bought juice and home juicing? (Not counting the cost of the juicer. ),Melody Joy,2019-08-21T21:31:52Z,0
Soo much more to buy! I would say almost double for organic,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-08-22T00:47:55Z,1

Why not drink celery smoothie? Wouldn’t it be healthier? And can you mix it with apple to make taste better? Can adding veggies make result worse?,Vita,2019-08-21T21:00:16Z,0
I sometimes add it to my smoothies to it’s just drinking it straight makes it easier to digest. Def adding lemon to it next time 🍋,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-08-21T21:28:02Z,2

I love celery juice. Add an apple if you hate it so much! I don’t put the leaves in the juicer. Too bitter.,Meri,2019-08-21T20:19:14Z,15
"HealthNut Nutrition Acquired taste? Lol! Don’t put the leaves in the juicer. Yuck! Very bitter. Sometimes I throw away the outer stalks, bitter as well.",Meri,2019-08-22T22:50:41Z,1

I tried celery juice for a stretch of time a few times but my digestive system never got used to it. I also was following the Medical Medium but decided to get off that train. He profits a lot from what he is doing and I just don&#39;t believe in a one size fits all approach,SimplyB,2019-08-21T20:05:37Z,24
How does he make a profit? He is NOT ENDORSING any products besides his books which are informative??,Francesca Bob,2020-06-02T22:45:11Z,2
