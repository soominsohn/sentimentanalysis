Have you considered buying a small fridge for your room?,djjones141,2019-09-22T03:44:35Z,0
Andreia Gomes I feel you girl! I did it for 7 months when I went abroad. Sharing housing SUCKS! I recommend finding recipes for meals that use some of the same ingredients so you don’t have to buy as much food. Canned soups are very convenient and much healthier than ramen. Bananas were my favorite game changer for breakfast. I would make pancakes with them since they don’t require as many ingredients as regular pancakes and freeze them or store them in the fridge and eat them throughout the week by popping them in a toaster oven or heating up in the pan (whichever is available to you). Eggs are also very versatile and Rice can save you a lot of money as a carb for most meals. My choice of protein is frozen chicken breasts Because you can generally cook them frozen or thawed. If you make one meal that serves several people you can portion the food into containers for the week as well. Try to stick to one or two fruits/veggies for the week too. My favorites were broccoli and sweet potatoes. If you’re on a budget go to the dollar tree for your spices and condiments. It’s amazing how much variety you can make from the same foods just by using various spices. <br /><br />I hope you find this helpful. Good luck! 💕,Vanessa Bouyea,2019-09-19T15:54:01Z,3
