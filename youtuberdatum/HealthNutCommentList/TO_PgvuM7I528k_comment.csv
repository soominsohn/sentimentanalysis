"Coconut palm sugar is still sugar - it really doesn’t matter whether you use that or maple syrup or honey, our body digests them all the same! Only rice syrup has a little lower effect on blood sugar levels. As a nutrition scientist it’s really important for me to clear those things up, as it’s simply plain wrong and transfers a wrong message.

"I will never buy dairy or meat from a grocery store ever again. 😬<br /><br />You get a stomach ache from milk, because Pasturized milk no longer has the natural enzymes it contains.

You won&#39;t ever have that problem.",Minimal Miranda,2019-06-27T13:57:42Z,0

"I believe the reason it&#39;s called &quot;vegetable oil&quot; is because it&#39;s plant based oil as opposed to being animal fat, not because it comes from veggies. So basically anything coming from seeds, nuts etc. Olive oil (which is good for you) is also a kind of vegetable oil. Peanut oil comes from peanuts so technically there&#39;s no reason to consider it unhealthy, if you then consider things like peanut butter healthy. I hope it makes sense.

IDK if it was intentional or not but I liked the double sense when you said &quot;the oceans are full of it&quot; while speaking about plastic bottled water....so true ocean is full of water but also plastic ;-),prisc.l,2019-06-27T00:05:29Z,2

"Thing I try not to buy are things that have animals in them and gluten foods. Im vegan and I am mostly gluten free. Not right now because i just want to have treats once a week with vegan meats. But the list I try not to get all the time is vegan meats and cheese&#39;s those things have plastic on them and also many of those foods are high in salt and most of the meats have gluten in them. Candy, pop, cereal and granola bars. Those are high in sugars and plastic. When i go shopping for a treat i try and find a place like a bakery so I dont need to use so much plastic. Chips and crackers those things you can make them at home and save not buying the plastic. I did just go to the store and get some stuff i try not to buy but I broke my leg last month and im trying to find meals for my brothers that are not hard for them to make for me.",Lukas Elijah Ephraim Larkins,2019-06-26T23:10:01Z,0
"Could you do a video on oils to buy and use? As well as the price points. The oils you mentioned (avocado oil, grape seed oil) are pretty pricey 😥 especially for oils, which most people use on a daily basis",Andrea,2019-06-26T23:09:55Z,5
Love this video. Was it a SuperStore or Save On Foods? There are lots of Canadians like me who have been following you and want to know more about healthy grocery habits in a Canadian grocery store/Costco. Can&#39;t wait for a &quot;Let&#39;s do grocery&quot; video in coming days :),Manpreet Singh,2019-06-26T23:01:50Z,0
