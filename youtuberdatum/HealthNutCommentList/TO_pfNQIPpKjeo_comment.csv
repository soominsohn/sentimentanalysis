"Hello Nicole! We sometimes take for granted what we have available, groceries in Canada are super expensive! Just for an example in my country a Papaya (the export kind) is only US$2, a mango $ 0.65 the only thing pricey here is the asparagus, we have availability of fruits almost all year round, only mango are seasonal here... but the rest of the fruits are always available..

The best way to do ribs is to season it and put it directly in the crockpot then after its done (4hours on high or 8 hours on low) you can put the bbq sauce and put it in the oven for 30 mins.  They are the besttt!!!!! Super easy!,Andrea Mejia,2019-05-28T18:39:53Z,3

"@HealthNut Nutrition he eats everything natural. He can&#39;t stand sugar. Papayas and mangos are his favorite. He runs through produce and brings me back whatever he wants. Broccoli, cauliflower, bananas, tomatoes, carrots. He points out watermelon and sweet potatoes for help. He barely eats meat and his snacks are mostly nuts, and peanut or almond butter. We both have a dairy allergy so when my recipes started failing at the beginning I turned to nature&#39;s candy and it worked.

Add 1 cup apple juice or apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1 tsp worshesher and chopped onion mixed on the bottom. Pressure cook 15-20 minutes, natural release. Then lay on a baking sheet with foil, coat in bbq sauce of your choice. Cook at 400° for 10 minutes. They are our favorite.

From Spring right through to Fall, there is an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables.  I live in Windsor, Ontario which is at the same latitude as Northern California so we are very warm here and our growing season is a lot longer than more northern parts of Canada.  We also have plenty of greenhouses so we are able to get fresh tomatoes all year long as well as strawberries and things like that.

I can&#39;t believe how expensive food is in Canada/ us.   Onion for example we would get for about £1 English pound and cilantro we could pick up for 65p.   May change when we leave the eu and have to grow our own food mind!  Love these vids btw,Stephanie Hitchings,2019-05-27T21:55:12Z,6

"Loved this! You can make a green pea mash, it’s delish! I’ve also seen peas as toppers on avo toast, and there’s  pea soup as well. I’m Portuguese and my mom used to make a version of pea soup with chorizo. So good!<br /><br />Also pre-ordered your cookbook and cannot wait to make all the recipes! :) xo",susie g.,2019-05-27T21:43:19Z,0

"I just preordered your book! I can’t wait until September😄<br />Also, I never realized how much you have impacted my health life. I found you with your What I Eat In a Day at Work video. You’ve taught me the easiness to a one sheet pan meal.. how to use my hand to hold the seeds when I squeeze a lemon.. how herbal coffee tastes just like coffee but without the caffeine.. how our mental health is just as important as our physical.. Thank you for simplifying health for us. For being authentic and keeping it real on how being healthy doesn’t just mean being “Instagram worthy fit.” I truly wish you and your team more success♥️<br /><br />Fun fact:when I was younger I though papaya smelled like 💩 but now I love it! I’m Mexican and I extra love it with some lime juice🤤",Jess Jess,2019-05-27T21:29:53Z,7

The green onions freeze really well. Chop them up and put in a zip top bag...and you can use them in your soups and stews or anything you are cooking.,S R,2019-05-27T21:29:27Z,7
"Shaneska Melendez yes it’s a herb saver for me lol...I chop parsley, cilantro, chives, and basil...the basil however I freeze some with water and some with olive oil in ice cube trays. The one with water I use when I am watching my calorie intake and throw it in my tomato sauce and bolognese sauce the water  cubes acts as a stock with basil flavor",S R,2019-05-30T02:16:29Z,0
Great idea to freeze them if you don&#39;t use them all! Love that.,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-05-28T20:49:42Z,2

"I never knew people didn&#39;t like papaya...what?!?! My mom uses it in veggie stews (the green ones are more savory) and smoothies. The orange ones are more ripe and sweeter. Add in some bananas, almond milk, almond or vanilla extract and some brown sugar and so good. Great later at night when you don&#39;t want something heavy. Or just eat it straight. And they freeze beautifully...people get on the papaya train!",Jennifer,2019-05-27T21:24:07Z,1
"@HealthNut Nutrition It is so good. The recipe is from Haiti and called &quot;legume&quot; (tastes way better than it looks) and again I stress use the savory green papaya, not the sweet yellow/orange ones else you will be in for a surprise 😬",Jennifer,2019-05-28T21:17:15Z,0
"Never heard of it being used in stews, that&#39;s so creative!",HealthNut Nutrition,2019-05-28T21:01:07Z,1
Do you re grow your green onions. Just started and it’s so cool. Put the little white bulbs in water and it will regrow. Great Canadian haul!,Gabriela Duclos,2019-05-27T21:20:32Z,0
"Thanks for the video! I love ribs too...cooked some yesterday actually. Not sure what kind you bought, I had baby back ribs. I season with garlic,pepper,cumin,oregano,smoked paprika. (No salt, I used a bottled sauce). Seared them well on my grill, then cooked them for 2 1/2 hours at 325 degrees. They were delicious!",L's Channel,2019-05-27T21:06:45Z,1

Roast those radishes. They become soo sweet and lose their bite. I also throw them in stews...so good.,LuAnn Pena,2019-05-27T20:51:09Z,2

Aww love that. You can buy these green onion    for a cheaper price at Asian grocery stores or supermarkets. I think doing Asia grocery haul will be a good idea too 😉,tam pham,2019-05-27T20:49:32Z,5
