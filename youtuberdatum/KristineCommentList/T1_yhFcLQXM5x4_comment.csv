You guys this was a very good cruise Vlog.  I wish you guys would do more.  I have done 15 cruises and I have to say I wish I could watch more of your Vlogs before  I go to my next cruise.  Very nice attention to detail and frankly honest opinion.  I&#39;ve heard terrible things about the Meraviglia and MSC is a lot different from the other cruise lines.  Would love to hear your Opinion of the Royal Caribbean Oasis Class or the Carnival Mardi Gras Class.,blackbirds4,2020-12-23T05:24:36Z,0

Wish you did not go on  cruise and promote this kind of travel. It is very bad for the environment. One of the most polluting ways to travel. They rarely help the local  societies. E.g. they don&#39;t pay taxes. Labour conditions are really bad. Just google it.  So many bad things about this industry. Love many of your videos. Not this one. Stay true your own values.,Per Sommer,2020-03-26T21:08:12Z,0

"Hmm, we haven&#39;t had much desire to go on a cruise yet either. Maybe someday... We&#39;ll have to look into the environmental commitments of MSC. The buffets with food available right away would be the biggest draw!  We just spent a week in an island bungalow and it would take the staff one hour to cook a meal, which isn&#39;t fun waiting for with young kids! 🌺Heidi",Kensho Quest,2020-02-14T08:30:23Z,0

"we went on Meraviglia in November.  The ship is beautiful.  The food is horrible.  We have cruised for over 30 years.  This was the only trip where I had to send meals back each night.  We were given a $400 credit for next cruise because we missed a port.  That credit will be wasted.  I am sticking with Royal Caribbean and Celebrity where the food is good.  The crew was very nice,  the ship beautiful,  the entertainment was OK.  No lounge chairs by inside pool.  Did not like that.  Too much smoke in casino and on deck.  We met two couples staying in the Yacht Club.  They also said the food was bad.  So it was not me being picky. Skip this ship.",K S,2020-02-01T17:43:25Z,0
I actually liked the food and im picky...and vegan. We just stuck to the buffet and specialty restaurants and enjoyed it. They def need better ice cream tho and the main dining restaurant where you had a set time each night..we didnt like that so we skipped it snd stuck to the buffet,Kristen & Siya,2020-02-02T04:07:57Z,0
please do a room tour. I&#39;m thinking of going on the MSC cruise as well but I&#39;m afraid of the the whole tiny room issue.,hnan .M .A,2020-02-01T08:10:22Z,0

"Beautiful ship. Went in November and for New Years. New year’s night wAs AMAZING!!!  The people that work on the boat are great, especially in the pool side. The only issue was that both times, ocean cay was cancelled.   Anyone that goes in the next month look fir Elizabeth, she is a waitress near the bar. Black African girl. She is beautiful and will take care of u. Just tip them.  But it’s a great ship",William Garcia,2020-01-31T22:45:49Z,1

"I&#39;m so surprised you guys actually liked it! I&#39;ve never seen the appeal of cruises because I feel like you hardly get to really experience the ports but everyone says the ports aren&#39;t the reason they go.... it&#39;s the ship. I don&#39;t know, I may have to give it a try now and just go in with the mindset of relaxing with a little culture instead of exploring for lots of culture!",Kammy Marie,2020-01-30T19:15:52Z,0
Thats exactly it. Its a vacation and not a travel experience. It was a whole experience itself and I enjoyed it for what it was. Especially the fact that I would have a great sleep and wake up somewhere new everyday. All of the luxurious things you can do and the food was great! - Kristen,Kristen & Siya,2020-01-31T01:13:21Z,1

"Really sad that an avid traveler, and supposed hippie that cares about the environment would go on a cruise, its one of the worst environmental trips you can go on. Cruises dump fuel, garbage and human waste into the ocean. Along with the moral implications of low wages and high profits and how little ports benefit from cruise tourism, the cruise industry has a severe impact on the environment.",X X,2020-01-27T00:04:42Z,2

"I find with kids, I have 2 under 10. It is really nice traveling when you sleep, waking up to a new island. Babysitting on board. Heaps of kids and adult activities, mostly all inclusive. I love cruises only down fall is sometimes you want to spend more time at a destination and on long cruises after 15 days you get sick of eating the same kind of food",Life As We know It,2020-01-26T21:53:54Z,1

Only a 4 day to make sure we both loved it and hubby didn&#39;t get sick lol and we are definitely looking forward to our next one, no less than 7 days for future cruises that is for sure.

"On an invitation to visit The Bahamas, you asked me why you should. The Bahamas is one of the biggest cruise destinations in the world. The CONTROVERSY over cruise ships is ripping my island apart over the purchase of LIGHTHOUSE POINT BY DISNEY. If you would like insight on that, email me at enchantmentgiftshop@<a href=""http://hotmail.com/"">hotmail.com</a> for a local perspective. I see cruising as a good option for retirement, and sometimes much more affordable than a nursing home. If one is in relatively good health, they can cruise around the world for several years after selling all their assets. A clinic, gym and exercise trails, swimming pools, chapel, library, housekeeping, laundry, activities with people your own age, not being a burden on your family, the list goes on. As a property and business owner for the past 15 years, and another 35 to go, there is nothing I look forward to more than selling this high maintenance property and everything I own, and being taken care of while traveling the world and meeting new friends. My last days should be spent finishing my latest writing project, watching a beautiful sunset from my cruise balcony, and sipping a glass of wine.",Sherelle Wallace,2020-01-26T18:19:07Z,0
