@Cherise Ellul I was so proud also I live in Australia and have Maltese parents but I still think I&#39;m Maltese even though I&#39;ve never been to Malta isn&#39;t that funny I think a lot of Maltese are like this even my little boy well not so little he&#39;s an hour 14 thinks he&#39;s Maltese but beloved Australia and also in some way think with it as Aussie as the next person it&#39;s very confusing,darren micallef,2020-11-01T14:54:27Z,0
@Stacey Mercieca do you realize the word pastizz has a slang meaning  . It can mean stupid or the female genitalia.  Look at the shape of a pastizzi . Sorry I just had to tell you that most Maltese have got a good sense of humour cheers,darren micallef,2020-11-01T14:51:16Z,0

Nothing to slecial about it though...i don3know if you tried hobz tal malti its practocly traditional maltese bread... and hobz biz zejt is what we call a ftira not in a pizza form with kunserva its ouke tomato paste... olives, gbejna its a type lf cheese, olive oil, capers yeah i thinks that about it... sometimes as an antipasto restaurants seve maltese water biscuits called galletti with bigilla its a dip i honestly don&#39;t know what it includes but its quite complicated to make soo... i could go on forever telljng you about food found only in malta but thats it... i don3sughest coming to maltq right now cause there is a bit of a political crisis i suggest coming in about a uears time should be fine or maybe next summer and bring your swimsuit.

pretty much all the cities in Malta have big ass walls.. honey rings are made with figs....the best pastizzi are the ones made with peas (Pizelli) and they are not generally like that circular one and they have very flaky pastry not like that shortcrust.. the chicken ones are also very tasty... the best in Malta are to be found just outside the gates if Il-Mdina imho .. a place called Ir- Rabbat called Crystal Palace. they are semicircle shaped kind of like a cornish pasty but they are all very tasty tbh.. BTW why do you have to eat and talk at the same time?? <b>shudder</b><br />You missed a chance at some FANTASTIC ice cream in Republic street at Amorinos and HOW ON EARTH DID YOU NOT TRY KINNIE!!!!!!! a quite unique soft drink only found in Malta as far as i know.<br />That Ftira doesn&#39;t look like any i have had in 15 years of going to Malta twice a year.<br />Malta is an amazing place with amazing people and an amazing history and culture.. I&#39;ll be there again in June with my kids and we&#39;ll be based in Fgura.<br />you need WAY more than 4 days to do Malta any justice,Pax Templar,2019-04-25T22:53:42Z,0

Sorry for spamming but you need to try the ottini with the tea. They are sesame biscuits. And figolli for Easter time . I could go on . Ok I miss Malta now. That also is not a real pastizz.  The real pastizz is from crystal palace tas serkin in Rabat. Those are the real pastizzi.  Crunchy and flaky.,Zefster,2019-04-19T04:11:09Z,0

"This video made my heart happy. I&#39;m Maltese and this just made me happy. I just wanted to mention a few things that you guys could have enjoyed more. The Pastizzi that you ate arent the original. They are similar but the ones that you buy from literally shops in the streets are way much better. Especially the peas one. Also , the pastini. If you guys bought them from a simple grocer , you could have got the maltese traditional ones with sugar paper and peanuts/almonds on top which come with a cherry on top aswell if you prefer that. Also the rabbit with gravy is just one of our favourite dishes EVER. Thats the maltese traditional Rabbit stew that you could have got with potatoes as well. Valletta has great stuff but if i where you , i would have visited some villages aswell because they really hold onto tradition and keep the recipes very old school. The best time you should have come to malta is during the summer so you could experience the village / city feasts. Those are the best thing ever.",Raissa Borg,2019-04-19T01:13:33Z,0

"Nice movie. Coming from a maltese guy, you managed to capture most of it. Hint, if you wanna know about traditional, never go to the turist cities. Go to the remote villages and get advice from locals, not from business owners.<br /><br />Also, if you want pastizzi, eat the original cheese and pea cakes, not the puff pastry alternative like you had. And do buy them from a pastizzi shop that makes (and bakes) his own pastizzi. You missed out on about 80% of certain delicacies.",Frederick Brincat,2019-04-18T10:09:46Z,0

Most of the pronunciations of the Maltese words are nearly spot on!! Great!,Dean Fenech,2019-04-18T09:15:08Z,1
"Great video sort of... But! You ate the wrong Pastizz (Pastizzi is plural). The pastry is not the proper one as is the shape, although the Cordina Pastizzi are delicious (but very expensive). Also the hot thick chocolate is totally Italian, nothing Maltese in it. The rabbit (as a local) looked disgusting and we never get a gravy bowl to pour on it. The widow soup looked totally wrong (but then again you ate at a tourist restaurant. And you never went out of Valletta to eat. You needed to go to the villages, the band clubs, restaurants that locals go to and to Gozo. And for Rabbit, the closest to home made would be the village of Mgarr where a few restaurants get it right and are frequented by the locals. You never tried our other national dish Octopus Stew. Oh and the sausage dish is not something we eat much at all. And it&#39;s Cisk (pronounced CHisk). And that&#39;s absolutely NOT how we eat Ftira. That&#39;s italian pizza toppings on Ftira bread. And not one plate of fresh Mediterranean fish or our most popular Pasta dishes,  &#39;Ravjul&#39; , Timpana, etc.... Sacrilege....",Jam Tub,2019-04-18T08:23:53Z,0

"@greentealover in most of the local pastizzi shop throughout all of malta which the shops are usually called sphinx (you can find them in Cospicua, Rahal Gdid, Fgura, Has Zabbar, Marsaskala and loads more places) and you will find almost in every locality a place which they sell pastizzi, and also the best pastizi are the traditional one,  not the round ones that they tried ... and for the best pastizzi there is a shop in rabat(next to mdina) it&#39;s called crystal palace, it is also knows as &quot;tas serkin&quot; if you ask any local they will tell you were it is , maybe they are a bit more expensive 50-60c but im not 100% sure.  hope this helps :)",Ryan Ahar,2019-05-30T20:20:27Z,3

"​@colex erm ever considered there might a difference between privatized car parks that issue tickets you then use to pay your way out and the ones that are just a parking lot that happens to have some guy that decided that he is gonna ask you for money to have parked there, you are not obliged to pay him, that parking lot does not belong to him - he wont be happy if you refuse to give him anything even though you dont have to - so you give him 1 euro and you can peacefully go about your day without the nasty surprise of finding your car keyed when you get back.

"Nice video! Was it hard to drive on the &quot;wrong&quot; side? I&#39;m going to Malta in 2,5 weeks, and I will rent a car. That last pizza was too much I&#39;m hungry now (I will try to go there too) :) Still one hour until lunchtime...",Tamás Csirik,2019-03-11T09:24:20Z,2
"quick tip from a local :) Country roads like the one you drove through are normally used by farmers to get to/from their fields. There are usually better arterial roads around to get you to your destination, but if you have to drive through a country road make sure to do so very carefully and slowly especially near bends where you can&#39;t see what&#39;s ahead, as you can easily find someone driving at you in the opposite direction :)",zandalf,2019-03-10T10:21:09Z,6
"Thanks for visiting our country :)<br />It&#39;s amazing to see these videos of our tourists enjoying the Maltese islands.. usually we underestimate the place and due to our busy lives, we do not tend to fully enjoy our beautiful hidden gem. Thanks to you, these videos make me enjoy Malta as a foreigner or tourist. Also, you&#39;d need a full month to truly experience the whole island haha, it offers too much!",GoodlipMT,2019-03-09T11:03:12Z,19
