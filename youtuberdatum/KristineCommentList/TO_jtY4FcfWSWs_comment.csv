"I wish India Pakistan and China were in peace. This entire area of himalaya, karakoram, nanga parvat, tibet valley would have been a much better place than switzerland and economy could have been boosted. Due to the politics, agenda and propaganda and arms business there is suffering. People from mountain across any countries are peace loving good people. Love for them....wish this enmity will end one day... probably soon",A,2020-11-15T20:32:57Z,0

"Been there, done that, bought the T shirt as they say except there was no touristy T shirt to buy!  After the crazy jeep ride, the hike is fairly rigorous for the non atheletic like us city folk and there are narrow points like a small shelf which only a single person can pass through that are a bit hair raising because of the sheer drop and do get the adrenaline pumping- but its so worth it for the experience and view at the top. Due to  altitude good idea to spend a little time acclimatising if u can before you climb. But there were all ages going up and down- I went on  foot with my  7 year old daughter and 70 yrs old Dad - it took us 4+ hours going at a steady pace. There are horses available too which the locals are happy to supply as it earns them seasonal income.There are clear mountain water springs as u ascend so you can quench your thirst on the way. Once we finally reached the top we we&#39;re so exhausted we just crashed onto mattresses they put out for us! Its best to set out early morning so you get to the top sooner  and u can maximise the time exploring the meadows. It is spectacular -outta this world and Nanga Parbatt look so close up u feel u could almost touch it. Theres an option to camp a the top and meals can be freshly prepared if u give your order in advance. The meadows were so pristine , and water crystal clear and I hope it stays like that forever.",Zeenat Rooky,2020-11-02T14:46:03Z,0

"I am from Karachi Sindh Pakistan, I&#39;ve visited (Hunza valley and mahodand lake kalam) these are such beautiful places I have ever seen. you know what we have all the things in our country like (mountain, Sea, 4 different kinds of weather, size, etc) but we are back just due to our corrupt leaders(government), also India and international media make fake propaganda all the time regarding our country to keep our country bad in front of the entire world that is why people/foreigners avoid visiting such beautiful places but on the other hand, the ground reality is far different from international media, the people of Pakistan are very humble and we live in peace we respect women, etc.<br />BTW, I really enjoyed your Vlog and every single person should visit Pakistan once in their entire life, you will get an experience that you can&#39;t experience anywhere in the whole world trust me Pakistan and Pakistani&#39; folks are so amazing, and their hospitality <br />Thank you!",Farrukh siddiqui,2020-10-20T08:18:07Z,0

For the punjabis, there&#39;s a piece of advice that don&#39;t try to be over efficient with the people there, and don&#39;t bargain a lot.

The view was breathtaking, but I spent my whole time in jeep screaming and praying while my friends laughed at me. 😂 On the hiking part, I laughed at them, because only one of them was wearing sneakers but others were wearing flat, soft shoes that could have fallen apart any time on our way.

"I climbed the whole way up 5 years back. It was a longer route back then, it took us 6 hours to get there. We climbed 3 hours while it was dark, we had no equipment no torches. I was certain I was going to die and just an hour before arriving my left quadricep pulled probably because of lifting heavy on the Leg Press. I limped all the way up. It was the first time climbing for most of us, yet we didn&#39;t use the horses. And when we needed the horses, it was already too late. It wasn&#39;t fun.",Ahsan,2019-06-22T20:31:42Z,0

"Pakistan takes our land then invites tourists to Kashmir, so called Pakistan to make money. Neither part of Kashmir belongs to India, China and Pakistan. They gave away part of Kashmir to China like it was theirs. No offence but please say Kashmir and not Pakistan, Kashmir was a country before India and Pakistan was.

I know many would think of Pakistani people as terrorists but hey not every one is bad. Bad people are everywhere but it depends on us which side we choose bad side or good side. Together we can eliminate the negativity and create a community that believe in humanity. Our Planet is very beautiful and we shall explore every part of it.

some mistakes there. international tourists must study about the local norms before coming to Pak. What you were doing/wearing is perfectly acceptable in most parts of Pakistan. But remember that certain small parts of Pakistan are ultra conservative.<br /><br />I was worried when the girls were riding on the top near Chilas. Now people of Chilas are super conservative. Be very careful when travelling through such parts. Tell the girls to carry a big shawl as well and to wear a shawl especially when travelling through super conservative villages.<br /><br />Just be careful with these super conservative towns.<br /><br />Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir are quite liberal areas.,Mega Lecture,2019-06-19T21:32:15Z,2

I was at Fairy meadows in 2012. One of the best experience of life. There were three colors there. 1. Lush green ground 2. Clear blue skies. 3. Broad White mountain of Nanga Parbat aka Killer mountain. I had never seen these three combinations of colors before my life in such a giant spectrum. Amazing,imran ali,2019-06-19T20:14:08Z,0

Bro proppsssssss ... you guys brave enough to make it to by the jeep. We went to fairy meadows in End July 2016 by foot. It took 11hrs from raikot bridge to the view point. It was when we said we never gonna visit this place again cuz we were 5 cousins and had only 5 Ltrs of water and it was 44 C°. Hope you had a clear morning view of the might Nanga Parbat. Btw in my opinion you guys should have come to Pakistan in after Mid july when the Babusar pass is open for traffic and most tourists visit. During that times the snow is also less and valleys are lush green. Plus the babusar pass roads are of international standard and no risky rides like you did from besham side. Besham side is for trucks and cargo and open in winter. Do visit Deosai Plains once in your life and Skardu when the snow is gone. Deosai is open by end july to End September and is lush green to Brown in two months. Later in Oct snows falls again. Peace,Abdullah Khan,2019-06-19T15:11:54Z,0
