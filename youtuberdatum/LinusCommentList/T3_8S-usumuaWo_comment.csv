"Even though this technology is AWESOME (it really is), it&#39;s a bit worrying imo. Just as we&#39;ve saw older forms of art get lost through time, will confectionary masters who study years, upon years to get these results be forgotten? Of course, this is an amazing product to democratize the craft, but an art form which has lasted for literal thousands of years DOES need to be preserved. It may be time to start looking into preservation for things as simple as the techniques required to create these sort of creation, at least in my opinion.",Hunter Roberts,2021-05-05T00:40:18Z,0

"How is white chocolate a scam? If you like creamy things, white chocolate tastes amazing. If you think it is a scam because they are ripping you off by charging the same, but not including cocoa solids, that doesn&#39;t make much sence because the most expensive ingredient in chocolate is coca butter and white chocolate contains more cocoa butter than regular chocolate. Both US and Canada have legal requirements for the minimum amount of cocoa butter in white chocolate.<br /><br />Calling white chocolate a scam would be like calling Jif or Skippy peanut butter a scam. I do not eat Jif or Skippy peanut butter because of how they make it, but I wouldn&#39;t call it a scam.",AllTracTurbo,2021-05-01T00:10:07Z,0

"When systems like this get better, it will be amazing.  Being able to precisely inject various ingredients throughout custom structures is going to be a massive hit for food production.<br />It&#39;ll also more specifically allow for incredible consistency, and in turn, less food waste or food that is some times a little strong or too weak in some areas because certain ingredients bunched up elsewhere in the food product during production.    Specifically being able to integrate air pockets in to some foods precisely will create things we couldn&#39;t previously create without incredibly hard production methods that usually result in other issues with regards to taste.<br />A device like this won&#39;t be doing it, but a much larger industrial scale version will be able to handle it.

"&quot;White chocolate isn&#39;t chocolate by the way&quot; - That&#39;s a common misconception. It really is chocolate!<br /><br />White chocolate is made from cocoa butter, milk solids, and sugar - just like milk chocolate - but does not contain any cocoa **solids**. Cocoa butter is made from cacao beans and absolutely qualifies as chocolate. In fact, it is the part of chocolate that is responsible for its ability to temper due to the formation of fat crystals.<br /><br />Fun fact: There is actually a fourth kind of chocolate called &quot;ruby chocolate&quot; which is produced from special cacao beans and processing with citric acid, creating a unique pink color and a slightly tangy flavor. A lot of people assume based on the color that it has fruit flavors added to it, but it is in fact pure chocolate.",Jon Molnar,2021-04-28T17:47:48Z,0

That why solid cholate didnt come didnt become popular until they found a way to add the milk and sugar and loads of other stuff. cocoa by itself taste like a coffee bean rather then cholate.,yoitsgunattack,2021-04-28T21:36:00Z,0

So that broken rail mount is probably the cause of the majority of your Z axis issues. I have a cheapo 3D printer and the majority of my issues were down to alignment of the Z axis rails and screws. It&#39;s amazing how even the tiniest misalignment can cause an enormous amount of friction which then results in the Z axis motors having lots of problems.,ISFiYIywAFIBc6qAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIQrXTJiCtY3Asd4WF,2021-04-28T13:01:35Z,0

"White chocolate, real white chocolate is ACTUALLY chocolate!! It depends on the kind of cocoa butter or if they even have cocoa butter in their white chocolate.<br /><br />Russel Stovers uses fake white chocolate that includes 0% cocoa butter. Companies like Lindt and other higher-end chocolate companies use varying amounts of cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and other chocolate components in their white chocolate manufacturing that produce a far far better white chocolate experience. Sadly you really have to research into whether or not a company uses cocoa powder or cocoa butter in their white chocolate.<br /><br />It is very frustrating when I hear SO many people say white chocolate is a scam and yet they don&#39;t spend the time to look at the ingredients of the white chocolate they consume. Often the white chocolate that tastes like just straight sugar is the kind of white chocolate that contains NO cocoa products at all.<br /><br />Meanwhile, if you go to a store and specifically pick out white chocolate that specifically has cocoa butter in the ingredients it is a far better taste and confectionary treat overall than your typical white chocolatey confectionary treat. Pay attention to the wording on the packaging. If it sounds like a generic or wishy-washy name that doesn&#39;t specifically say Chocolate, it isn&#39;t really white chocolate.<br /><br />The same can be said for regular chocolate. If it says Chocolatey or something else other than Milk Chocolate, or White Chocolate, it isn&#39;t using the proper components of chocolate.<br /><br />The Theorist channels(Food Theory on YouTube) have a really good video that talks about the different chocolate fake names based on the percentage of cocoa powder used in chocolate products. <br /><br />I am a huge fan of white chocolate and cannot stand regular chocolate. Because of that, I have done my own blind taste tests of good white chocolate versus bad white chocolate, and there is such a dramatic difference in the consistency, flavor, and quality between multiple different brands that produce white chocolate.<br /><br />I have also gone to chocolate manufacturing companies where you can buy massive BRICKS of white chocolate such as the Chocolate Nugget Candy Factory that happens to have multiple stores in the Nevada, USA area. They use only the finest ingredients for all their chocolate products and it absolutely shows. Their white chocolate uses cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and various other ingredients that are also used in regular chocolate products! It is far better than the garbage most chocolate manufacturers produce, and unlike most companies in the USA, it actually fills your stomach whereas most white chocolatey confections or white confectionery sugar products typically feel like you are just consuming sugar and just sugar.<br /><br />Please do more research on White Chocolate before you call it a scam in your videos. It absolutely isn&#39;t a scam, it depends on who is making the white chocolate, and what ingredients they use.",Kris Bright,2021-04-28T10:43:09Z,0

"GUYS, just no, you just 3D print a PETG form (uncolored PETG is food grade safe) and then you pour in hot chocolate and DONE. And you can repeat it many times way faster. Why all this trouble. For complex shapes you can make more PETG layer forms.",Qaesar Flavius,2021-04-28T09:53:37Z,0
"There is a good way to use this kind of 3d print outside of food. I dont know another  material that similar to chocolate when it comes to temperature behavior, but what if I 3d print a model, cast it on sand to make the mold, then cast metal in it. The chocolate model then can be melted back into printing material easily. With plastic, you need to buy extra equipment just to reuse the printed plastic back into filament. With chocolate, just a kitchen stove and a pot should be enough.",Its Silence,2021-04-28T09:39:56Z,0
I wonder what the advantages to this over printing a silicone mould would be. I feel like there are very few cases where this would be &quot;better&quot; than moulds/ melting multiple moulded parts together,T4nm4y,2021-04-28T09:39:41Z,1

"&#39;&#39;Until 2002, white chocolate was not considered “chocolate” in the United States, but rather a “confectionary.”  Previous FDA standards of identity required that “chocolate” contain chocolate liquor, which gives chocolate its brown color.  Due to petitioning by the Hershey Foods Corporation and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, FDA published a final rule that established a standard of identify for white chocolate in 2002.  To be marketed as white chocolate, a product must contain at least 20 percent cocoa butter, at least 14 percent total milk solids, at least 3.5 percent milkfat.  It cannot consist of more than 55 percent nutritive carbohydrate sweetener.&#39;&#39;<br /><br />So yes Linus, White Chocolate is Chocolate....Deal with it ;)",Alexander Webley,2021-04-28T09:12:51Z,0

"&quot;It involved white goo in my mouth&quot; finally my fantasies have come true<br /><br />EDIT: For real though I&#39;m not a tech-head so when tech-heads go on about what is fine I trust them. Everything Linus is saying about the chocolate is 100% accurate and it might scare people off from making chocolate. Don&#39;t let it. It&#39;s 100% a science, and this machine simply added more complexity to the process due to the fact it&#39;s a complex machine involved in making a complex confection. The complexity becomes super complex!!!!!!!!! <br /><br />But for real: tech heads who don&#39;t know anything about cooking, baking, anything food: don&#39;t worry. All chocolatiers go through this process of bungled, bloomed, non-tempered chocolate. If you&#39;re interested in learning more, Emmymade and How To Cook That have videos explaining chocolate tempering whittled down into pretty streamlined, simple explanations.<br /><br />Happy chocolating!",Calum Sanderson,2021-04-28T05:43:38Z,0

"I think that thing you said about coreXY giving performance improvements is not really that true, sure if you go perpendicularly to the axes of the machine you use both motors but in the same way if you go diagonally with a cartesian 3D printer you use both motors, meaning that depending on how you slice your prints it will not matter, in theory also a coreXY has more pulleys and gears for the belts giving marginally more drag but we are talking orders of magnitude below everything else.  <br /><br />The main point to a coreXY 3D printer should be that it doesn’t have a motor on one of the axes giving several advantages:<br /> - lower inertia on the moving axis makes the motors work less and can make the print head move faster<br /> - the motors don’t have to endure the stresses of being in a heated enclosure (when there is one)  <br />- there are less hard to clean/sanitize parts in the enclosure, probably the most important advantage for this specific printer",Giorgio Alamia,2021-04-27T18:15:32Z,0

I love how this 360p problem is known by youtube for years now and it still isn&#39;t fixed that processing takes AGES,Torben Mayer,2021-04-27T17:57:13Z,135
"@Daniel Wolf Yeah I doubt what you just said. Not the processing part, I know how long processing takes. So I&#39;m gonna explain to everyone here WHY I am complaining, and WHY this can&#39;t be as intended. <br />A few months ago, I uploaded a test video, which was 45 seconds long. Somewhat about 2GB filesize and HDR. So YES, this takes a longer time to process since it&#39;s HDR, no complains yet. However, this video took about 6 days (yes, DAYS) to get rendered in 4K.  So I searched the web for this problems and found tons of posts regarding this, reaching back some years already. For testing I uploaded the same video file twice. This time it was a big one. 40 seconds long, 10GB filesize, ProRes 4444. The first one that was finished uploading, I left untouched. The second upload, I used a trick I read about on the internet. After the SD version was processed, I went to the editor, added some free youtube music from the library and waited until the SD version was finished processing again. As soon as the editor was available again, I clicked on: restore original and waited again. Long story short: With using the trick with the editor, even that big video was processed after about 3 hours. The other one, that actually was uploaded first, took 9 days to be fully available in 4k. <br /><br />Basically, If you upload your stuff in 4K in a somewhat higher quality, you need to use the trick or pre plan your videos about a week. And now please, please tell me where this isn&#39;t a bug but working as expected? I&#39;m not complaining about speed in general, basically, the speed is pretty much fine if you use the editor trick. I&#39;m complaining that this editor trick is used for years now to fasten the processing significantly. YouTube said once they fixed it (so it was considered a bug) and it now again is bugged again. This time it got fairly fast on this video, but even among bigger youtubers (1mil. sub+)  this is a known problem where their videos stay at 360p for up to 2 days when they release the upload as soon as its done. <br /><br />So no, It&#39;s not about my f*ing viewing pleasure, it&#39;s about that there is a way that videos are processed faster, and the standard upload is often enough not able to go that way and YouTube knows about this for years, just look it up in the forums.",Torben Mayer,2021-04-27T20:05:57Z,0
There&#39;s over 500hours of video to be processed every minute if the video isn&#39;t to your viewing pleasure for 3 minutes then fix the processing problem or stop complaining,ahmed vahed,2021-04-27T18:31:55Z,2
