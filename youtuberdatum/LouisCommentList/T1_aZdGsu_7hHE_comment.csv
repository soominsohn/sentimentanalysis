How is this woman speaking American English without an accent if she comes from Afghanistan?,derekcolman,2020-07-01T01:41:36Z,0
"She doesn&#39;t have an American accent, she has an English accent, because she lived in London. It sounds like her family moved there when she was a child so that&#39;s probably where she learned English.",Gabriel Traveler,2020-07-02T04:40:32Z,1

"&quot;What kind of a society do we want to live in?&quot;  One where the communities seek workable solutions to their needs.  Voting for people and living in countries run by people, who often are corrupt, shows just what effects it has on humanity.  When we start voting on solutions based on needs, often the basic needs - food, water, shelter, education and health care - we will thrive. But as long as the ruling elite use military and police to protect the assets and wealth of the ruling class and their leaders, millions of innocent humans will continue to suffer. <br />A thoughtful and well planned project based on  the carrying capacity of the planet, a resourced-based economy, rather than a monetary system (which continues to ruin the planet and all her living creatures) is <a href=""https://www.thevenusproject.com/"">https://www.thevenusproject.com/</a>  <br />&quot;When your children are healthy, educated and cared for, my life is better. -Roxanne Meadows<br />Thank you Louis for giving voice and images to so many in need.",Michael Thomas,2020-06-30T20:52:55Z,0
