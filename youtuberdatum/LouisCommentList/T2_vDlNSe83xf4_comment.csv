Oh PLEASE do not sacrifice your chance at recouping your money for the sake of the kickstarters getting to see it a touch early. We invested because we believe in you and we were excited about the project but please please do not feel that you owe us that.  I would rather never get a copy of the blue ray (a device I don’t even own anymore tbh) and eventually see it and know I played a small part in its creation.  Please really consider before you release without contract. We support you!!!,Kylie Lynne,2020-12-09T08:03:38Z,1

Sometimes, especially when times are tough, you need to look out for yourself. Your supporters supported you on kickstarter, kickstarter is not a store, it&#39;s an investment.  It appears that the investment all your supports gave will pay off, it will just take a little bit longer.  Believe me, they are willing to wait.

Wow ! Consider my mind scrambled !  Congratulations on so many levels. I greatly enjoyed the journey in the rough cut YouTube episodes and can&#39;t wait to see the polished version. I find it hard to believe that YouTube TV didn&#39;t want it for original content on their new platform ... seems like an obvious natural extension of the concept. Sounds like a new chapter unfolding for you :-),Travels with Yoly,2020-12-04T02:25:42Z,0
