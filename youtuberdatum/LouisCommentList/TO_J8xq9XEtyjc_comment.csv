Jennelle watched van life videos when she was in high school.  <br />She probably learned how to create a better video by watching alot of videos.  <br />She practiced making  videos for a year until she was happy about the quality of her videos before posting her first video on Youtube. <br />Practice does improve the quality of a video.,Alexander Richardson,2020-05-25T12:29:13Z,1

Her video was recommended to me no matter what I watched and I never clicked because I wasn’t interested at the time. Even though I’ve searched vanlife before. I learned of who she was cause of all the commotion and then went to watch her. Glad I did though!,I AM MIHKAH,2019-09-08T21:34:35Z,0

"@jennelleeliana Did I call it or did I call it? And just wgen I was going to ask if I could call you. Oh well! Anyways, now that you&#39;ve given more details about the whereabouts of where you work you should be just a tad more careful out there. Trolls live looking people up. If nit just so they can say they found you. Here&#39;s a tip though. Before exiting your van why not check your mirrors furst? Safety first after all. I live in my truck. I travel over the road. The cirrent company I work with doesn&#39;t deliver on your side of I-35. Therefore I couldn&#39;t visit you anyways. Yeah I could because I sometimes get invited to Hollywood for exclusive events. The Saturn Awards is bext week &amp; I&#39;ll have to decline this year. Maybe next year will be better for me. There are still a few venues coming this year though &amp; I might just take them up on their offer seeing tgat wintertime is coming. If I was still with my other company I could get loads to bring me out that way. They still want me to come back too! Us truckers are always on the watch out for things out of the ordinary out here on this road. You never know when you might pull into a town hust like Hoboken! If you haven&#39;t heard of Hoboken then think Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Hills Have Eyes. You got a lot of serial stalkers &amp; killers out here. Some are cannibals. Some are sanguinariast or vampires. I&#39;m not saying to live life sxared. I&#39;m just sating, Eliana, be careful. I want to replace your boyfriend one day!

"Blue Room also, I like that Janelle has (or had) a regular full time job, and that she’s honest about eating out every day.

The day in the life videos are really helpful though, because I can see how they manage their daily tasks.<br />Based on watching these videos, I want to do a Murphy bed, so I have seating, but don’t have a big production when it’s bedtime.  I’m also designing a closet/ storage system for hanging clothes, that has a pull out drawer for a composting toilet, and I’m trying to figure out a way to add in a shower.  <br />I don’t want to have to plan my days around toilet time and showering.",NicCanDance,2019-09-02T15:47:53Z,1

It looks like a movie set. She carries herself with an unfamiliar way. like someone who practiced a few times before shooting a scene.  When you look at how she rose you can see Youtube promoted her show. either way she does not look like any full time person living in a Van I know... everything is so perfect there is no way you live in that space 24/7. , this snake does not  like extreme heat 78- 80 degrees  In the S.

"He is cute!  Now his appearance of looking drained and sun kissed from living this type of daily lifestyle for years is the way I would think a truthful van dweller would appear - Not Jenelle&#39;s fresh polish glowing looks after over two years.  Wow! I do love her beautiful white bright teeth!  LMAO!  His facial expressions towards her is priceless, especially when he asked about feeling safe, traveling and being a Youtuber!  Even he isn&#39;t buying her fake BS, and crazy ridiculous answer to all those questions, especially owning a snake while living in a gas guzzling van. Like he said, &quot;he would own one in a house&quot;.  Who purposely wants to live in a van, and say they plan to keep doing it, especially if they have money.  And who put, first she said someplace else it was $10,000, here she said, &quot;btw $6,000-$9,000, in renovating an old van. What I mainly do not like is how she is glamorizing this very dangerous lifestyle causing young girls to think about living this way when SHE CLEARLY DOESN&#39;T LIVE THIS WAY HERSELF, NOR DOES ALFREDO.  So if you do have a job or plenty of money until you find a job, and you are thinking about pursuing this lifestyle - DON&#39;T!!!!!!

"Jesus this doesn&#39;t help. I&#39;M NOT SAYING SHE&#39;S LYING. But This Is The Type Of Video You WOULD Make If You Were Lying! So it leaves everything in a grey area. <br />Person 1: &quot;She&#39;s an actress.&quot;<br />Person 2: &quot;But Wait, She Says Her Most Frustrating Thing Is That People Think She&#39;s An Actress!&quot;<br />Person 1: Oh ok. Cool. Then she isn&#39;t.😊&quot;<br /><br />Like... no. The Truth isn&#39;t provided within people&#39;s ability to just simply SAY &quot;no, I&#39;m not&quot;. If she were, you think she would SAY It?!?! I just don&#39;t get it. If she is, she could just be very well using that down-to-earth attitude of hers that got her hired to just Say she isn&#39;t. Plus, if she is, she wouldn&#39;t Be ABLE to put out that information! Which might explain her slightly Uncomfortable look and facial expressions in this video that I didn&#39;t see a Trace of in her viral videos! Probably because dealing with REAL People now versus just &quot;those who hired her&quot; is scarier and more off-putting than when she can just work for them and be by herself!<br /><br />AGAIN, I&#39;M NOT SAYING THAT SHE&#39;S AN ACTRESS OR <b>ISN&#39;T</b> AN ACTRESS!!!

"So cringe and uncomfortable to watch. Literally interrogating her and no doubt people will compare the answers she gave to what she’s said in previous videos to try and work out the lies and conspiracy... I mean can’t we just watch a girl in a van, with flawless hair and makeup, not paying rent, still working a job who lets her have time off to travel half the year and allow her to build her van in their car park. And can’t we just escape from our 9-5 desk job and imagine how bliss life will be when we buy our own van and travel the world, meet another roady, have babies, become vegan etc. Gosh. So what if she said in her last video she would hate to travel the van in the cold and couldn’t handle a cold climate which contradicts what she said in this video! So what! Her videos help me to imagine what life’s really going to be like when I quite my job and live on a island and catch fish and bathe in the sea.
