"best of luck . sure what ever you do will be successful creative and hart-full . but the couple channel.....  but <del>this kind of content is very conservative and it dsnt seems like it is you. its more content that is &quot;ment for woman &quot; like many female bloggers do</del> which i find just suport the  &quot;New Age female Content &quot; beuty stsadarts and the capitalism around it. though i understand the need to make a living while personal grouth happens. also I think weman blogers need to step forward from this position, and be just a blogers just as the man are. and find more professional, tech, stories, collaborations and just subject, and content  than staying this sphere. its really depressing to see so little of them. please dnt take it the wrong way. much success",NIKI,2020-08-08T10:20:19Z,0

"Louis, you have truly inspired me, I have lived so much more after seeing what could be through watching you. I started watching you when I was 15, because of you I bought a penny board, I skated everywhere a 15 year old could go without a car. As I got older I got to do more and after I began driving I got to come to Vidcon and meet you, you signed my little pink penny board. I&#39;m 21 now and don&#39;t think of you often, but coming back to this now, I see how much you&#39;ve shaped the way I grew up. I celebrated my 21st birthday living my adventure on the rim of the Grand Canyon, and I&#39;m absolutely sure you played a hand in that.",K D,2019-07-22T00:18:29Z,0

"I began following along in 2011/2012 and to see Louis&#39; life change has been insane. I think of the old Steve, Ben, Jack &amp; Finn, and Will gang as the OG YouTubers. Looking back at what I&#39;ve done since I was 14 (when I was just getting into the videos), I can honestly say the OGs made a huge impression on me. As a 22-year-old now, I&#39;m not sad to see everyone changing - it&#39;s just a new adventure :)",L.E. SHULTS,2019-06-15T01:23:11Z,0

"Hey Louis! I enjoyed your daily vlog videos, but I think this new direction and perspective you have to encourage other people and meet the reality, situations and amazing qualities of the people around you will give us, the audience, even more reasons to feel and get inspired by the way you are and how you see the world. I think it is the start of something great! Hope we can meet someday! :)",Aby U,2019-06-14T19:49:16Z,0

There are a lot of people your age who did not have this technology when we were younger but love the effects of good editing, whether that&#39;s a photo or video.

"I remember another content creator citing you and this channel as the &quot;godfather&quot; of the daily travel vlog, which i thought was very fitting. Back in 2012 there was really nobody on YT producing the type of content you were, so you definitely pioneered a style that many others followed and were inspired by. But as you said yourself, putting out such content daily for so many years burns out everyone, so this next phase is necessary but also exciting and hopefully invigorating! I think you for sure have the drive, ethic and ideas to make it happen. <br /><br />So from my past highscool self who literally watched every vlog from Vidcon 2013 to Haloween 2014: Godspeed, Louis :))",fullysickrockstar,2019-06-10T23:50:27Z,94

You’ve ‘grown up’. I have taken a lot from this video because I’m head of social media😂 at work and it’s always good to be reminded that change is necessary. Your quality of filming and editing is second to none...it’s a quality of aptitude that cant be learned...so I’m looking forward to following on your Facebook page.  Good luck,wooltweed,2019-06-09T17:17:43Z,0
"Yesss love these ideas. I just want to say you inspired me to travel. Thank you for sharing your life with us. I&#39;m so excited for what&#39;s to come. I am going to India this year with an organisation called Days For Girls. They provide reusable sanitary pads to girls in areas of poverty, to prevent girls dropping out of school due to their periods. Often the girls end up in prostitution due to lack of education. Many are sex trafficked...all because of no sanitary pads!!! I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;d be interested to discuss or share about in the future? If so let me know. So much love ♡♡♡",Priestess Peaches,2019-06-09T15:38:06Z,0

I think it&#39;s safe to say your vlogs changed a lot of things in my life. I will always treasure it. I haven&#39;t been using yt much for the last couple years but this video caught my eye and here I am. It&#39;s good to watch you on my screen again. Thank you for everything, truly, I wish you all the best. I hope I have the chance to meet you someday and thank you in person. The ending brought back a lot of memories.

"I remember discovering you in the beginning from your foodforlouis channel and your tv cameo where you redesigned your room<br /><br />The foodforlouis might be a bit on the slow side in 2019. But I’ve been observing that building, in any sense, has been a very fruitful topic on YouTube. And not the double decker vlog type of videos but maybe a time-lapse type situation where it culminated slowly over a couple of months (rebuilding a room, design of small portable houses, etc)<br /><br />I can see you thriving from that, that’s if you have the time for any of this, LTA seems to be a busy routine but this would be fun to watch if you could!",Karim,2019-06-09T06:16:32Z,0

"Hi Louis, hope you read this. <br /><br />You always sign off the videos &quot;Live the adventure ... BOOM!&quot;. So, just change the channel name to Live The Adventure. Jesse did this with his channel, pretty sure YouTube will tell you to do the same. You have worked hard to build this channel to where it is today, looking at Social Blade the channel has lost 4,000+ subs in the 30 days to June 6th 2019, in all likely hood, because of the slow down in uploads. You already have LTA videos in the channel playlist, so start a new one &quot;LTA 2019&quot;, &quot;The Social Good Club&quot;, etc. Push Fun For Louis through IG/IGTV you already have 1.3M+ subs there. At the time I&#39;m posting this, this video has 82,000+ views in the two days since it was uploaded, but the new LTA channel has only picked up 1,300+ subs and 1,268 views in the same time period. By posting LTA videos to this channel you will already have 2.0M+ subs who are willing to watch weekly uploads, you&#39;ve already done the hard work why do it all again?",Martin Randall,2019-06-09T00:05:15Z,0

"Hi Louis, <br />just wanted to say that I’ve been following you for many years now, I started when you were daily vlogging and haven’t missed one video since ! You’ve been and still are such an inspiration, I remember being amazed at how much you were travelling and posting videos so quickly ! I love your open-mind, and the beautiful shots you always put in your videos ! :)<br /><br /><br />Being myself a traveler, I’ve always dreamed of recording all of my adventures on video, but was always too shy and scared to do so. As a resolution for 2019, I told myself I would finally dare to do it and realize my dreams ! I now post travel videos of my adventures in Europe (and sometimes in my city, Paris) weekly and that makes me really happy !<br /><br /><br />Even though it’s really hard to get an audience in the beginning, I am not losing motivation because I think we should all be doing what we love the most and then love will come to us ! <br /><br /><br />If anybody here wants to support me in my journey, come and have a look at my channel and videos, my last one I just posted today is a hike to an incredible location in Spain (they shot there for GOT !).<br />Any encouragement, feedback/suggestions &amp; blessings would be so helpful !<br />If you liked this video please like, comment and subscribe, I’d be really grateful !<br /><br /><br />Bilbao vlog : <a href=""https://youtu.be/jLDu5FEC7eM"">https://youtu.be/jLDu5FEC7eM</a><br /><br /><br />Next Sunday will be a vlog from my trip to Milano, Italy !<br /><br /><br />Thank you so much for your support and you’ll always have mine Louis !<br />Peace out, enjoy life and live the adventure ! &lt;3",Paradisienne,2019-06-08T10:36:49Z,1

Is positive to show what is normal real life as well as the exciting stuff. Am sure your channel will only get even better.

"Hi Louis, I&#39;ve recently been traveling in India and liked your idea of reaching out to interesting people looking further into their projects. I met someone called Murali in a beautiful place called Hampi (not sure if you&#39;re familiar). This man is looking at producing a film called &quot;I love my country&quot; I really liked his idea and he hasn&#39;t sourced too much interest so far. I think you could change this and it&#39;s really interesting what he&#39;s working on. I recommend you check it out on his YouTube &quot;Hampi Film Production&quot; or good Facebook, Muralidhar Gidijala.<br /><br />I doubt you&#39;ll ever see this comment but I respect this man so much and he deserves some identification! ♥️",Ben Pretending,2019-06-08T00:03:06Z,0

"im not usually one for writing comments but good decision man. have watched you since 2015, if I remember correctly, and you&#39;re right that your format hasn&#39;t changed much. I often have conversations with myself breaking down some of the youtubers I watch and finding out why I watch them or why I&#39;ve moved away in order to help me make my own. really like you as a person, you&#39;re very good at being real on camera even when you&#39;re doing simple things, not just when you do sit down videos. you are very are natural and always have something to say to the viewer but I will have phases of watching your videos loads and then taking a phase of not watching them and its totally down to how the story of your videos are structured. the structure definitely worked for the point in your life of travel and exploration so it&#39;s 100% true that as your life changes so should your content.<br /><br />your videos reflect your life well enough to give off a raw aspect of meaning and value, so it would be a real shame if you did stop making content in general because the world could do with it. just find a way of creating that alines with the theme, the pace and story of your life as it is right now and find a way to keep it unexpected with out losing some form of reliable structure. (doesn&#39;t necessarily mean daily vlogging either).<br /><br /> but yeah man, keep on keeping on. loved watching your content for a long time and its helped shape my own. so thanks",Euan Ball,2019-06-07T20:04:22Z,0

"Back in 2013, I developed crippling anxiety and depression. I was 16. I wasn&#39;t in therapy. I didn&#39;t have a close friend to confide in, my parents don&#39;t believe in &quot;mental health.&quot; The only sense of calm, or distraction, that anything gave me, was YouTube videos. Yours were the only I could rely on everyday. I was suicidal. I&#39;d watch your videos and remember how there is so much that I still have left to see in my life. How I want to travel. You might get this a lot, but you are honestly a big reason as to why I am still here. Thank you for dedicating 6 years of your life to this. You&#39;ve most likely saved a lot of people during that time, and I am one of them. Now I am 22. I still have anxiety, but now I am living with the love of my life and not with my unhealthy parents.

"I will be completely honest with you regarding my opinions on this subject with  this post louis, just know you have been my favourite content creator on youtube for years now. I have watch basically all of your videos, some more then once. About to go back and watch your slovenia vlogs as that is my next adventure in august haha.<br /><br />I used to come in from a day at work and the first thing that i would do is hop on youtube and watch the next funforlouis vlog. It was something i looked forward to all day as you were living the life that i wished i could live and hope one day i will have time for, full time employment means i only have 20 days a year holidays to travel with. I feel like i have to disagree with your comments on the format becoming stagnant, i feel like many others like myself still looked forward to your vlogs and i think your comments section over the last year or so have shown that.<br /><br />Personally i have really found it difficult to bring myself to watch your videos as of late as i have not enjoyed the content and feel rather detatched from them. Looking back i have not yet watched your last 6 before this one, although i do plan to.<br /><br />To me it is not the format of your videos that has caused the decline of your channel, actually quite the contrary, i think the inconsistent uploads schedule and also a stray away from the type of content that the foundations of your channel was built on previously (travel vlogs).<br /><br />Now on your side of things, i fully understand that as an individual your life has to move forward and that is perfectly fine. People change and situations change that is all part of the cycle of life, nothing lasts forever. Also you have seemed alot.happier over the last 6-7 months than you did toward the end of your daily vlogs which is great to see!<br /><br />I think if your video formats change you will again find growth with your channel as you are a great guy with alot to give to the world and other people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not sure if i will be part of that growth. As someone who has watched as long as i have, i am finding myself disappointed every time i check your channel and there has been no upload for 1-2 weeks, or i didn&#39;t enjoy your latest video like i used to.<br /><br />I fully understand and respect your reasons for wanting a change of pace in life and a change up in content. I wish you all the best in your future endevours and i will attempt to enjoy your future content in whatever format it may be.",Luke Burrows,2019-06-07T15:29:47Z,0

Board masters festival I was watching your North Korea vlog on my phone.. Then as I went to get some cash out. You was standing at the machine!! !.  I was too star struck to say hello. I just looked in shock..as you walked past and went left up the hill.. I did take a cheeky pic 😉 You don&#39;t know me...

Casey is moving to V.B. too. Your not going to collab? With Dobrik perhaps? Or say, Colleen Ballinger or ijustine or something? Louis don&#39;t give up on the YouTube community in L.A. maybe you weren&#39;t invited to VidCon, or something? Trippy wasn&#39;t invited either. Isn&#39;t that weird. Your too good an editor.

All of the times you are HELPING others in your videos are my FAVOURITE. And I can tell you have so much love to give in your soul. It speaks to me. I did tire of the travel vlogs and I slowly dwindled from watching every single one to skipping some. I became sad when I read the title but very EXCITED to watch the video! These changes suit you - I could tell from the moment you guys moved into your apartment in Cape town I saw a change in you! It&#39;s time for you to settle and I am happy you are accepting that. I have gone and subscribed to live the adventure (#387 I think) but really look forward to just seeing snippets of your every day life on this channel, even if they are monthly, bi monthly, whatever works for you and your new life.

"To be honest, I think you’ve done more than would have been expected of anyone vlogging. Back when people were still making those foreign candy tasting videos you were going hardcore with the vlogs, travelling the world and sharing your day to day life whilst inspiring people to get out of their houses and their comfort zones and see the broad world around them and all the different kinds of people it has. You gave us that and for that you have more than our thanks, you have our gratitude. I believe it’s completely normal for this to be happening to the channel as it happens with most content creators as they’re finding their way after an adventure ends. Even the legendary Phoenix has to give up a lot in order to welcome a bright new adventure. Don’t be afraid of the channel’s numbers going down because those who’ve been with you for the right reasons and have really seen you through it all will stick around. You’re more than explorations in caves and underwater excursions or instagram missions  and we know that. We all saw the Beyond Borders vlogs and saw how passionate you were about those stories you heard and wanted to tell through the documentary. Honestly that’s where I envisioned your channel evolving into. I saw you uploading short film like videos giving people a voice to share their human experiences, giving your opinions on each topic and starting the conversation on things that really should and do matter, as often times we’d rather drown out the noise than try to find out why there’s noise or where it’s even coming from. Just do what you feel you need to do in order to be happy and achieve the dreams and goals you wish to achieve from here on out, don’t be afraid of the numbers dropping because just like life, it’s hills and valleys, you’ll lose some but the ones you’ll win will be with you for the long run, and that’s all that matters in this case. <br /><br />Thank you for the vlogs and all you taught us through them. See you on your next adventure Louis!",Aaron Moiche,2019-06-07T00:37:44Z,0

I&#39;ve been following you for 5+ years. I told my friend Megan about you 4 years ago and how brilliant you were and that she should connect with you. She was in your last video both performing and hanging out. I have told many people about your vlog and about you. Your extraordinary positivity and desire to be a genuine for for good has been TREMENDOUSLY INSPIRING! Your relationship with Raya has also been an inspiring inspiration. I have followed your move to LA and how it has positively impacted you (and Jesse Wellens) and I couldn&#39;t be more happy for you in exploring your creativity and your ability to be a force for good. I am from LA and have a studio in Santa Monica and have deeply enjoyed your point of view and desire to make the world a better place. You certainly have inspired me! THANK YOU LOUIS COLE!!!!!!!!

"Good luck with the transition. I agree it will be a welcomed change to start experimenting with some different styles of filming and editing to create different content. I think more of a focus on the places you visit would be interesting, rather than a daily vlog of your life, or maybe filming some of the quirky characters and things happening in LA since you&#39;re there. I&#39;m in a similar place of wanting to shift into a different phase. Posting videos almost every day is intense, time to step back a bit and take a different approach soon.

I&#39;d just like to say thank you for the huge number of high quality vlogs you&#39;ve created over the years. Personally, I enjoyed even the simplest vlogs you made, like, hangouts at home. So thanks for what you&#39;ve done so far. I understand it&#39;s an important decision you had to make because it&#39;s not just about us, the viewers, but mainly it&#39;s about you, your life, your relationships.

I&#39;m super grateful for all your sharing, because I&#39;m not able to travel much and you gave me an HD vicarious tour of exotic lands and experiences.  I love how you were so loving and chill with all the people you encountered.  You really modeled that well for me.   Last week I saw Casey Neistat leaving NY.  And now you make this announcement.

"Just seeing you looking much healthier and happier is amazing Louis. I wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life. We have to keep moving and changing, it&#39;s the only way we experience growth. Look forward to hearing about your new adventures. :)<br /><br /><br />P.s it was not necessarily the travel that drew me to your videos, it was your joy, love and kind-heartedness that you don&#39;t see often in this modern society.",Dean Swindells,2019-06-06T22:28:12Z,0

"I&#39;m 40, and I finally went on my first international trip a few years ago after being inspired by your videos to travel farther and see the world. I hadn&#39;t even had my passport before that, and now I&#39;ve been on four international trips in as many years. Thank you!! (And with only using google flight search, I&#39;ve found extremely cheap flights for every trip. $275 from the US to Bogota, $375 from the US to Amsterdam or London. It&#39;s pretty easy to travel on a budget with the right research.)",Max Brand,2019-06-06T22:22:56Z,0

"Since the reach is no more there anyways, he clearly had to do something else. Having 2M subs and having less than 10k views on videos is not sustainable... Louis knows it, and advertisers/partners clearly know it too. I used to watch this channel every single day. But since the Fly Beyond Borders adventure, who has been the most amazing serie I&#39;ve watched on youtube, ever, I find the channel fell flat, no more great adventures... What could have been a stepping stone in this channel&#39;s history, just ended up as a drowning stone. So many promises, the Happiness Bus became an AirBnB, Spa Bus just... disappeared, and on and on... But DAMN, I want the new projects to work! I want to be addicted to this channel again! Can&#39;t wait for that to happen. Best of luck Louis :)",TheGreatEscape,2019-06-06T22:15:49Z,0

I look forward to this new direction you&#39;re going in, but I will say that a lot of your videos of late have felt like you have something to sell.

"Speaking of impacts.  I remember back in 2012 I was Aupairing in Australia. Only 18, with a penny board and a 50L bag it was my first big trip.  The kids I looked after would always ask for &#39;Food for Louis&#39; and we were hooked. We watched them every morning before I dropped them off at school. Then came the Vlogs. You were the original travel vlogger and inspired me to make my own videos (Starting back in 2013).  <br /><br /><br />Cut to 6 years later with an undergraduate degree in Geography, and now a certified teacher (and travel vlogger), I&#39;m so greatful for your talent, charisma, and drive for exploration that you shared with everyone.  Great ideas for the new endeavours, hopefully I can join.    Thanks",EvanturesTV,2019-06-06T21:51:29Z,26

"What an inspiration! Thank you so much for this message. I turned 29 two days ago &amp; I decided I&#39;m really going to make this last year of my 20s count. Live life to the fullest, push myself out of my comfort zone. I&#39;m an addict so from 17 to 25 - a huge chunk of my life, much less my adult life! - I was just wasting away in active addiction. No memories, no accomplishments, no achievements during that entire 7 year period. Just a needle, a spoon, and heroin - that was my world. I&#39;ve since got sober! Coming up on 4th sobriety birthday next month! I&#39;m incredibly grateful for the grace of God and all of my time sober, but there&#39;s still something missing and I can&#39;t help but always thinking about how much time just passed by that I wasn&#39;t living my life. Barely even surviving. Now that I realize how precious our time on earth is, how fragile life is, how short it is, how much people take it for granted - i just can&#39;t allow myself to do that. I can&#39;t live a &quot;mediocre&quot; life. I&#39;m going to force myself to stop being complacent PURELY out of the fear and anxiety that comes with trting something new and different, and I&#39;m getting out there and going after my goals and dreams, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone in the next 12 months. I know 100% I will be happier in the end. I mean what have I got to lose? Thanks for the inspo &amp; motivation!!!!!!!!",Kayla Riggs,2019-06-06T21:29:42Z,0

Feels like i have gotten to know you through your vlogs and im sad i can&#39;t catch up with you through them anymore.

I think there comes a point in all our lives where we want to find our one place in the world and just slow down. It doesn&#39;t make us less of a person or make life less interesting or exciting in fact in my opinion it has been so much more exciting.  Wishing you all the best in all you do. I think it is very admirable for you being so upfront and open.
