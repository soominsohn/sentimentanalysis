"I have an Apple Watch I don’t wear and pay £20 per month for it. I’m ok paying it to finish the contract off. However if I delete the plan from the watch, would I be able to give the watch to my gf for her to add her own plan to it. I would obviously still pay off my subscription.",Robert Durham Music,2021-05-07T03:56:34Z,0
"Today introduce New Apple watch 6.<br />We have lots of option have been released. The First option is Case type. We have Aluminum/stainless steel/titanium. And The second option is The size of case. We have 42mm and 44mm. I personally felt uncomfortable using a small device while using a large Apple Watch. The Third option is color. Now Apple is pursuing casual colors. So, New Apple watch6 have New color. Blue and (PRODUCT)Red. I got Blue one. Next Fourth option is GPS and Celluar. Celluar modal is not good👎 Will be introduce performance. <br />The most innovative feature is Automatic Mac unlocking. But New IOS14.5, It also supports unlocking the iPhone. And new Apple watch supports ECD. But I was putting other Koreans, including some countries the health authorities is unavailable not obtain a license.<br />I pray for the approval of some national health authorities as soon.<br />And next new Apple watch band. We have lots of band. It also supports the Hermès Band a luxury brand, and Nike band for comfortable exercise. <br />This Applewatch can use, IPhone user and wants casual watch.<br />We have question. Why we can use apple watch6? Because Accurate heart rate. <br />Protect your healthy.<br /><br />This watch is expensive and nice. The price starts at 399 US dollars and ranges from 950. If you add it again and again when you buy it, the price becomes very expensive. This is Apple&#39;s plan.

"To be honest, the Apple Watch SE is by far the better choice IMO. When you consider price, performance and features the series 6 just isn&#39;t worth the premium price compared to the SE. The extra cost isn&#39;t worth the 2-3 extra features you get with the 6. I bought the space grey SE and it&#39;s been an excellent purchase, I&#39;m so happy with it. I honestly feel that for 95 percent of people, the SE is by far the better choice if you want an Apple Watch.",PJV1990,2021-05-02T02:42:29Z,0

"PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE GLITCHES STREAMING SPOTIFY ON  Apple Watch WITH THE Nike Run Club app<br /><br />Praying this gets acknowledged because its a serious problem I AND OTHERS have experienced while running with the Apple Watch (I&#39;m series 4 but my friend had series 5) streaming spotify. before you skip I&#39;ve been working with and sending logs to a team at nike (who are doing a great job staying in contact) and it seems that streaming spotify while using the NRC app causes frequent crashes. I&#39;ll leave at 85% battery and stream Spotify, watch dies 30 mins in, comes back on for a minute, and dies until I charge it at home. Then after 10 mins on the charger it goes from 65% to 75%?? not sure if this is a &quot;spotify issue&quot; but I&#39;ve gone on runs with downloaded MP3&#39;s with no issue, have 80% battery capacity on my watch health, and no issues streaming Apple Music in the past.<br /><br />Pretty disappointed apple hasn&#39;t fixed this since they sell a Nike Apple Watch with the Run Club App LITERALLY pre-installed. I&#39;ll try Apple Music again for a month and see if it &quot;solves the issue&quot;. I&#39;ll keep you all updated.

"Marques is totally cool for mentioning that MOST people aren&#39;t upgrading devices every year.  I just bought a Series 6 for myself, as well as my mother who recently had a stroke and fell down at home.  Luckily I was there, but I shudder to think about what would have happened if I was not.  Anyway, I waited to purchase an Apple Watch until the kinks were hammered out and new features added.

"I’ve never had a smartwatch at all, but a man wears his watch on its left wrist despite the saying that you can wear it where you want or that the correct placement is the opposite of your dominant hand. Just think of the placement of the crown wheel, it’s supposed to be facing outwards, so that your other hand can access it.  Having the watch on your right, puts the crown wheel on the inside, and you’d have to twist your left hand awkwardly to access it.<br /><br />So, a watch is to be on the left wrist.  (There might/should be options with the crown on the other side for left handed people, like there are inverted guitars, but I’m not aware of it).<br /><br />To see why I’m right... check a photo of Obama, he’s left-handed but still he wears the watch on his left wrist correctly.",Beni Rodriguez,2021-02-15T06:06:51Z,0

I was trying to decide between a Garmin and Apple fir and all purpose triathlon and every day wear watch because if the prices. Although Garmins are more durable and “tactical” I like the features of  Apple that Garmin cannot match. So I’m going to pull the trigger in Apple mostly due to price difference between the two and comparability with my iPhone. In a pinch, I still have my old Garmin 910XT that still works well. <br />The pulse ox question has a new relevance since the pandemic started. It’s one of the main criteria that is used to determine when you have a patient who is sick at home and you’re trying to determine whether to send them to the hospital or not, so it’s  kind of really relevant these days.<br />Great video, great job, great guy! 😎",Cookefan59,2020-12-23T22:03:58Z,0

"apple watch se 44mm GPS with a black sports band has been on sale for $259 on amazon, walmart and you can price match in best buy like I did. has almost the same specs as the apple watch 6.  I think the only things not present are the ekg and blood oxygen app, and no always on display which is slightly larger. se only comes in aluminum finish, which is fine. and the series 6 has a generation higher processor and heart sensor, that&#39;s it.  It&#39;s a lot less than the series 6 price, paid about $275 total with tax for mine.  the same size apple watch in the series 6 line is about $455 total with tax.",trashacct,2020-11-14T15:22:42Z,0

"Just FYI Marques for advice for others: if you are between two sizes for the solo loop, I would go with the big size. I was between 6-7. Your advice to go lower did not work for me at all to a painful level because I made a super rash from the band. A 7, a bit loose like a regular watch, is way better.

"I got you, recently purchased a Wifi only Apple watch for this reason. Without Cellular you CAN listen via bluetooth to music or podcasts you&#39;ve downloaded while connected to Wifi, but not from any popular hosts with the exeption of Apple. The question of compatibility now shifts to the question of which streaming service do you use. IF you get everything from Apple Music/Podcasts then youre set. Downloads and bluetooth listening are no problem. But spotify notably does NOT allow bluetooth listening unless you have a phone in the vicinity, because it does not support downloads. Strangely enough the only 3rd party service that I&#39;ve seen allowing downloads is Pandora Premium...likely due to the lack of real competition to Apple Music.

"Yea, at first I was like &quot;but I want the oxygen thing that my last-year&#39;s Watch doesn&#39;t have&quot;. Then I got a grip and just bought a fingertip pulse meter with bluetooth and a companion app that puts all the readings into the Health app - and my Android-wielding apps-hating  husband can use the pulse meter just as a stand-alone tool and see the readings on the little screen.<br /><br />As for Sleep, I&#39;ve been using an app combo of Smart Alarm (for the Watch) and SleepMatic (for tracking on the phone). I suspect that it&#39;s better than the new Sleep because basically I set the latest time when I need to be up and Smart Alarm picks a moment within a 30-minute range before that time, when I&#39;m the most ready to wake up, so that it&#39;s more natural. And of course it taps my wrist.",Iryna Kirtak-Craig,2020-10-20T20:22:41Z,0

"I love the channel.  But... I disagree with your assessment of the battery and I’m not sure why others aren’t talking more about it.  It’s a huge improvement from my Series 4.  I used to run 13mi with my Series 4 with all sensors active and music.  I would start with a full charge and would have 35% at completion.  After receiving my Series 6 I ran a 17mi run with all sensors active and music playing.  I started with a full charge and had 55% at completion.  So I went further, had even more sensors running with an always on display and had significantly more battery remaining after completion.  Here’s the real life impact.  Based on those results, the Series 6 would make it through a full Marathon.  The Series 4, would not.  It’s not very scientific but it’s the single biggest reason I am glad I upgraded.  Oh... The other big difference.  The GPS map plotting is far more accurate.  It doesn’t cut through or round off the corners the way the Series 4 did.",Jpbergin2,2020-10-18T06:13:03Z,0

if a person has a series 3 would you recommend them to stay with it or buy the new one? Btw I bought that watch like 1 to2 year ago.,Ravneek Mann,2020-10-14T23:25:19Z,0
"I just got the 6 and I have the 3. It&#39;s definitely faster and brighter and you can hear calls better over the watch if you have the cell version. You get 32 GB storage over the 16. This new version is supposed to support some type of car remote unlock feature in the future that Apple hasn&#39;t implemented yet. No idea,how that will play out though.",no you cannot,2020-10-15T06:49:46Z,1

He says reviewers don&#39;t take into account that most people will upgrade from old watches or no watch at all and then he goes on ranting how the series 6 doesn&#39;t add much compared to to the series 5. He is being incongruent. For me coming from the series 2 this is a huge leap and the series 6 has been amazing with tons of new features.,NullSleep,2020-10-14T20:45:35Z,0

"Why does everyone downplay the &#39;always on&#39; feature, as if nobody really needs this? Telling time is the #1 reason a watch exists, and if you have to make some ridiculous gesture or tap your watch to see the time, it&#39;s a total fail. Try that in a client meeting without looking like a tool. For this reason, the series 3 is not &#39;good enough&#39; for most people. It has the one biggest fail of this watch since inception still in it.",chiane1968,2020-10-14T17:01:23Z,1

"I can’t believe I am so lucky I found a $43 smart watch that does even more than Apple.

There’s a little game, oxygen level with no problems blood pressure, heartbeat, sleep, control shutter on phone, control music on phone, various types of sports tracking and water resistant.  I would never spend $400 for a watch.  I think Apple took you for a ride.  I love my watch from Amazon.  Oh and there are so many pretty and or functional watch faces.

Honestly the blood oxygen reader (SpO2 for those in the medical field) isnt that great of an indication of oxygenation. It is often wrong in either direction. Perfected happy healthy dogs sit there with 89% which should be almost comatose while a dog that is activtly turning blue is aroun 97%. The EKG is also kinda misleading since if you dont know how to interpret them it is not helpful to you at all or give you an anexity attach because it might not look right.,Carol Baker,2020-10-13T23:06:51Z,0

"To be totally honest, I wouldn’t buy another Apple Watch if you already have any of the previous models minus the series 3 maybe. The blood oxygen monitor is merely a gimmick that works perhaps one in twenty attempts for me at least. The faces though plentiful don’t really offer anything major over the series 3 I upgraded from, some look fussy with more complications in truth. Actually think the bigger screen makes some look less realistic and more like a picture of a watch face for any without a black background. The battery is no better at all in real life situations. The main reason I bought one was the always on display which is the only model now featuring this. Is it faster? Well it’s a watch and speed isn’t really something you’d ever notice day to day. Nice watch, due an overhaul.",bala8oo,2020-10-10T15:28:31Z,0

"Now, here is the counter review in short order: I&#39;m 55 years old with several comorbidities. I have had a major heart attack, some respiratory issues, and a mini-stroke when I was 39 years old. I am doing very well now, but it was a hard road. While for someone around your age and relatively good health these new health features on the Apple Watch (which are not new in the marketplace), it is a godsend. Yes, it&#39;s not completely accurate in all things, but to have multiple ways to track several measurements that at least gives someone like me with my health issues a good IDEA of where we are — including fall detection and the other features in earlier updates — the peace of mind ALONE eases significant stress. Which is good for your health. Which makes it worth the extra few hundred dollars. I do NOT want a half a dozen gadgets to keep up with, no matter how much less expensive they are, unless it is merely to have them on standby for more accurate readings if need them. Having a singular device that gives me REASONABLE confidence in the technology? Absolutely. So, is the Apple Watch 6 worth it for people who don&#39;t need those features? Probably not. But don&#39;t sort of passively dismiss the millions of people for whom these features may not be perfect, but they are damn sure worth the extra price.",DS9Sisko,2020-10-09T20:45:14Z,208
"Totally agree with you.  I’m in my 20’s but have health issues including a form of tachycardia. I’ve had the series 3 for a couple of years, but I’m looking to upgrade to the 6 within the next month. To have the ECG feature and fall detection is so important to me and my independence.",Faye Wheeler,2021-02-13T17:15:37Z,0
"For these cases Apple Watch works perfectly with the electrocardiogram. Unfortunately SE doesn’t offer it also, only the series 5<br />With the system of 🆘 which in case you don’t reply within 15 seconds calls it for you",Guilherme Miguel Velosa,2021-01-30T14:55:17Z,0
"For me you can’t just buy and wear the watch as a style or as your notification extender tools. You have to do it whatever it said like close your activity rings, breath focus etc, and you’ll get the effect of wearing this tiny computer, the algorithm inside this device is worth the price and amaze me everytime",Galih Prasetyo,2021-01-22T14:54:48Z,0
"The SE does the same thing. SO2 is never accurate. If you&#39;ve had that many issues, please get medical-grade equip and not a watch.",Z2,2021-01-16T20:08:22Z,1

"What irritates me with Apple is that they don&#39;t seem to see their full potential. I mean they can basically create anything and it will sell because it&#39;s Apple. Apple is not only a tech brand, it&#39;s a sort of fashion brand. Here in Sweden, if you walk into a classroom, 90 % of the student will have an iPhone, it&#39;s a sort of status symbol almost. Anyway my point is how can Apple not have realized that people might want DIFFERENT watches?? I currently have an Apple Watch 4th gen but since buying it I&#39;ve rarely used it for more than work because it looks geeky, I want a stylish watch that I can wear in all situations but with Apple watch features and user experience!

If that can save me a hundred bucks or a couple of hundreds even, there is no reason to go with the new one. Especially when the previous model will get the new software.<br />The sacrifice is about life expectancy. As long is my model supports the latest software there is no reason to switch.",Tor,2020-10-07T15:05:01Z,0

"I am 69 had a series 5, my mom who is 87 and in pretty good health had a series 3 and my 14 year old, yes I have a 14 year old daughter,  had a series 4. I got my mom a series 6 Product Red due to the fall detection, heart rate monitor and  blood oxygen monitoring. I upgraded my daughter&#39;s to the blue, just because she wanted it, and my wife had recently upgraded to the series 5 and is happy with it. I am a diabetic but still in pretty good health and active and it was very hard for me to decide this time to upgrade to the series 6 but I made the jump this past weekend. I always get the Space Gray aluminum because that is what I like. I have had it for 5 days and can&#39;t tell a lot of difference from my series 5 except that the screen looks some brighter, battery seems much better and the oxygen sensor has given me a rating of 100% and 99%. If you are like me and trying to decide I find it better than the series 5 and much better than any series prior to that and I have had every one since the original.

"There&#39;s 2 main reasons I won&#39;t bother with an Apple Watch<br /><br />1) it&#39;s tethered to iPhone - make it stand alone or at least synch to Android as well<br />2) In 2020 a 6th Gen smart watch shouldn&#39;t be offering 1.5days as a &quot;reasonable&quot; battery life. Competitors like Garmin, Hauwei, Samsung, Xiaomi are all offering weeks of battery life and more features are lower prices.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with the Apple Watch 6 tbh, Apple is about a year behind it&#39;s Asian competitors ITO tech but at least it&#39;s still a nose out in front ITO of software and complete platform. <br />I&#39;ll probably pick up a Coros Pace 2 to meet my fitness needs and stick with my Android smart phone.

"Let me tell you at the outset that it does not relate to this video but all your work in general.<br /><br />I have been watching your videos for couple of months now and have always been thinking to write my appreciation for your work. Unfortunately, I never got that chance and fortunately I’m here today writing my first review about your YouTube Channel.<br /><br />I got to hear about your Channel from the Founder (Pramit) of a Social Tech Start-Up which I’m working with. He is a visually impaired and building an App named as Louie Voice Control that allows a user to do everything within his phone with just voice commands. None of the big names like Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri can do everything that Louie does. These Voice Assistants tend to be superficial &amp; will allow a user to do only 2-3 things within an App. Louie in comparison will fully voice control an App - each and every feature within the App. Also Voice Assistants or Personal Assistants have a nasty habit of going silent every now and then. Louie in comparison does a two-way continuous interaction – just like a human interaction with the user.<br /><br /><br />In short, Louie is an accessibility App and can be used by all voice-lovers including but not limited to visually impaired, blind, motor-disabled, elderly, people with limited manual dexterity and all hands-free lovers.<br /><br />Between Pramit has based many of his devices purchasing decision on your videos and he has always been happy about it. May be this is why he recommends your videos to almost everyone in the team.<br /><br />Now, coming back to myself – since I’m always interested in Tech stuff, Pramit recommended me to subscribe to your Channel &amp; watch your videos. In fact, we got many ideas for our YouTube Channel after constantly following your work.<br /><br />I love the simplicity of message and your communication style in each of your videos.

Can you do a comparison for the Apple Watch five to the Apple Watch six on fall detection I have a five I have had 8 to 10 falls where I’ve been unconscious I’ve had my son who is a brown belt in jujitsu have his instructor throw him and he has done Falls 20 of them the watch went off once when he stood up he would lay still for two minutes this is the third watch Apple has sent me have had the same problem with all three wondering if it’s worth changing to the six,Chris Boardman,2020-10-04T18:07:42Z,0

"I think I may for my Christmas gift to myself upgrade from my series 2 Apple watch to the 44mm series 6 Product Red with GPS+Cellular.  Reason is that I am an older &quot;Person at Risk&quot; and feel it is the best option for me to help monitor my health.  In looking for the one other feature I would need it looks like I can add third party glucose tracker that will work with Apple Watch applications.<br /><br />Seems like pundits like to like to view the Apple Watch design through a GQ lens.  First thing is most normals do not cares about the shape unless it is catching on things, or is just butt ugly.  <br /><br />Before I moved to the Apple Watch series 2 I used the Casio G-Rescue Solar Atomic Classic Color Watch which lets just say from a style look is not the best looking.  The four screws and the outside of the Casio G-Rescue case are not unlike the size, and shape of the Apple Watch.  It has a round face, and you can change the face of the Apple Watch to a round layout.  You can also change the Apple Watch face witch you can not do with the Casio G-Rescue.",Brent Smithline,2020-10-04T15:58:18Z,0

True that on the upgrading comment you made at the beginning. I went from the iPhone 8plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max that what like 3 new iPhones that had released since. Still know people on the 6s and they have no problem with them such as my mom and some friends. Just cause other people have it you shouldn’t feel pressured to getting the latest new tech. And if you can then that’s ok good for you but if you don’t want to or you simply can’t that’s fine too we shouldn’t judge others!!

By 6pm and I’ve finished my standing hours I still have more than 60% charge. And yes, I’m the asshole the charges my devices even thought they’re at 100. Sleep monitoring has been... Interesting.

"I personally have to disagree with your stance that the Series 6 isn&#39;t a worthwhile upgrade from the Series 4. To me the difference is night and day. The always on display makes a pretty big difference and the battery life improvement is very noticeable. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just imagining this but the Bluetooth connectivity (depicted with the AirPlay icon) seems vastly improved from the series 4. Connecting my PowerBeats Pro to my Series 6 works every time, not to mention instantaneously, as opposed to a pretty hit-and-miss experience with my Series 4. It seems like a lot of glitches that made the Series 4 frustrating to use at times have been smoothed out in the Series 6. I&#39;m sure a lot of these upgrades made it into the Series 5 last year but frankly I couldn&#39;t be happier with the Series 6 so far.",BradfordFitch,2020-10-03T23:26:12Z,0

"Once you. Set sleep tracking, you don’t have to do anything. It’s automatic. And this is the first year. Apple has a philosophy of coming out with a major feature with fewer options that some competitors may have. But ove the next few years, they continue to add features. They are more concerned, at first, with getting it working properly, than adding a lot of options. We know a couple of companies that add “features” that either don’t work well, or at all.

"I have had the apple watch for the last few years, and was using a sleep app (kind of sucked and wasnt super practical), but wearing the watch to bed introduced me to how easily I could shut off my alarm when it went off on my wrist. Also,  I ended up telling Siri to set my alarm through my watch when I realized I forget to after already going to bed.  I am glad there is more focus on sleep, and saving energy to make it easier to wear it at night. <br />That said, I&#39;m sticking with my Series 5 until it breaks down, or Apple makes a watch that has sensors that can function through the apparent &quot;fog&quot; of there being a tattoo on my left wrist.

I wouldnt pay too much attention to a low blood o2 rating when standing up. If you stand up. When you stand up the blood in your upper body tends to get into your lowerer extremities when standing up because of gravity. That why sometimes you can get that „lightheaded“ feeling. Its mostly venous blood and not atierial but if it dips like 10% for like 5-10 sec while standing up that should be relatively normal,TheBigGameTheoryHDx,2020-10-03T08:53:10Z,0

Good point. Same Goes with phones. Upgrading every year is really unnessesary.

Luckily this year is year three again :D. Hope my watch arrives soon. Anyone else had to wait because they ordered the new magnetic leather band?

Very well said about new versions of things. 12 months are not that big of a time frame to make big leaps every year. For the sleep tracking tho - apple are claiming that they didn’t add more stuff because they don’t think the measurements will be accurate enough. Wrist movements alone are not enough to know what is happening is your brain. That’s why they are focusing on “let’s help you create better sleeping habits”. Which I honestly like much better.,Tihomir Valkanov,2020-10-03T06:57:54Z,2

There are numerous, as in a whole bunch of fantastic looking manly, masculine smartwatches on the market, with the exact same features or even way more sophisticated features, and they look fantastic, casually elegant sort of rugged even, on a guy.

"So it&#39;s simply not much of an upgrade. The single thing that bothered me the most about previous generations, was the battery life. And clearly with this so called upgraded watch 6 , you are getting about 18 hours of usage. That is not great.. Having to charge your watch every night. When the Samsung&#39;s and Huawei watches need to be charged like once a week. And some of them have wireless charging.

The SE would be the ‘sweet spot’ with AOD. It’s under rated as a feature. It makes a smart watch look like a watch. If it was just a wrist computer there wouldn’t be a massive choice of colours wrist bands and watch faces. It would probably cannibalise sales of the series 6 but certainly there are plenty of buyers who are not so interested in the health features,Mark Bennett,2020-10-03T05:40:55Z,0

"That&#39;s the thing about these watches. It&#39;s marketed as a health device. It makes you think you&#39;ve walked a thousand steps. It makes you think you have x amount of calories burned, x amount of oxygen in your blood, x amount of hours of sleep when CLEARLY, all it does is mere guessing. All those sensors are either unreliable or straight up gimmicky. Like who TF measures oxygen through your wrist? I know it has some practical uses but I&#39;ve seen people depend on these devices to &quot;keep track&quot; of their health or sleeping pattern.",eyomme1,2020-10-03T04:54:49Z,0

"I&#39;ve been living with the SE as my first Apple Watch, and something I discovered is that Sleep Tracking doesn&#39;t even require you to wear the watch. It seems like a feature that just unlocked in the control centre on my iPhone once I started using the Apple Watch. So I can toggle the sleep tracker from my phone when I go to bed, and even if my watch isn&#39;t on my wrist, the watch and phone both go into sleep mode together, and they track my sleep based on my interaction with the devices, which is more or less just as accurate.<br />I don&#39;t think it was a feature in iOS 14, but it totally could be. Locking it behind the Watch feels like a Memoji situation, a flex that watch owners have over regular iPhone users.",JMotion,2020-10-03T04:47:05Z,0

The sleep function is and always has been nonsense. Let me tell you this by comparing to way way advanced sleep tracking technology like the Oura ring: the Apple Watch overestimates your sleep by a significant margin. As Marques said the Alarm function is amazing and I’ve always used the Watch for that. You charge the thing while being in the bathroom brushing your teeth and showering and while doing the dishes. That’s more than enough time as it never gets below 60%,.,2020-10-03T04:17:12Z,0

Honestly apple watch is just not a good device for actual fitness tracking - it&#39;s whole selling point is the number of features it has and connectivity with iPhones. <br /><br />In terms of fitness and especially sleep tracking it just doesn&#39;t come anywhere near Fitbits which literally lasts a week+ on a single charge (even Versa goes 3-4 days on each charge). <br /><br />Get it if you want an Apple Watch.

Honestly I got the SE and it’s so much more of a value. Unless you absolutely need the Heath metrics and the AoD the SE is the sweetspot.,Khalil Shuaib,2020-10-03T01:41:24Z,39
guitarman For me it’s nice to be able to see the time etc without having to touch the screen to wake or move my wrist sharply for it to register and then switch on. But when I had the series 4 it wasn’t even a thought so I was more than happy to do without it. I’m not interested with the cellular version as I always have my phone with me. I think the SE will suit you then if the AoD is not a necessity.,Radford_07,2020-10-04T18:47:17Z,0
"Radford_07 Yes, I see no good reason to pay extra for AoD. I never really understood the reason to why it was added in the first place. All it does is that it looks better in others perspective imo. Other than that, it just drains your battery faster. To have the option for it however is never a bad thing, so if I can get a S5 for the same price as a SE I see no bad reason for it. I had a S3 about two years ago and was very fine with how the screen turned on every time I wanted to use it. I sold it however cuz I didn’t feel like it had enough features to make me satisfied. That’s why the SE is so interesting, cellular for a much better price which means I can go out running without my huge phone and still have all the things I need! Now I’m just waiting for Spotify to add music streaming to their watch app, which they are beta testing at the moment!:)",guitarman,2020-10-04T10:59:00Z,0
guitarman its all preference. If you can do without the AoD then I’d say definitely go for it. All the other “upgrades” are just gimmicks and won’t make your day to day life any better. I wouldn’t have upgraded from the S4 if I hadn’t have broken it. (I like walking into walls it seems) I am glad I got the S5 as I bought it a couple of months ago for a lot cheaper than what Apple would charge. No need to get the S6!,Radford_07,2020-10-03T09:19:47Z,0
They’re a lot cheaper with cellular connectivity as well! One of the reasons I’m looking to pick one up. Probably waiting till Black Friday tho cuz if the cellular S5 get similar prices I’ll definitely get one of those over the SE.,guitarman,2020-10-03T08:01:48Z,1
That’s fine if you’ve never had an Apple Watch with AoD. I was on series 4 and unfortunately broke it so bought a series 5. And honestly I can’t think of having a watch without AoD! That’s a reason in itself to upgrade.,Radford_07,2020-10-03T06:37:01Z,4

I still rock my series 1 and I&#39;d like to upgrade.  I planned on getting a reduced price Apple Watch 4 last year but Apple decided to mess with us last year by NOT reducing the price of the 4 and instead just discontinuing the 4 and giving us only the options to buy either the 3 or the 5.  That was kind of messed up on Apple&#39;s part but I see what they were doing.  They knew the 4 was a game changer and they didn&#39;t want to let people have that discount just yet.  Now this year with the SE I may finally get my upgrade since I don&#39;t have enough to throw down on a 6.,Muticere,2020-10-02T23:46:08Z,0

"For me the most underrated thing of the new watchOS is that during the watch sleeping hours, the watch face doesn’t like up every time I move my arm. Plus the watch face changes to be a dark lowlight face and slowly light up when tapped. <br /><br />I usually wore it to bed but I could tell when it lit up even with my eyes closed (when laying on my arms with wrist by my face). This was annoying and I couldn’t change it easily. Now it automatically doesn’t react to movement when in sleep hours.

"y’all you tubers seem to be assuming these health features are only for sick people or if you have heart or lung issues. It’s clearly not, because like you said you need more consistent and serious medical tests. Having these types of devices being built into something you wear all the time is more beneficial for notifying people if there are signs of problems they don’t know they have and getting people to get to medical professionals. If you notice your blood oxygen gets low at night and match that with heart rate fluctuations you may go to a doctor and find out you have sleep apnea which can be a dangerous disease. You take some random ecgs and you find out you could have a fib which has become pretty common but doesn’t have many noticeable symptoms until you have a serious cardiovascular event. So yeah they aren’t selling points but some of y’all have the idea that it’s a failed product meant for sick people.. but I think that’s wrong. It’s a successful implementation of a moderate to high precision medical diagnostic tool on your wrist, which especially in the US where 1/4 of adults have heart related diseases, you may can find these things early and make lifestyle changes before it’s too late",Rawkfist1501,2020-10-02T23:39:34Z,0

"Love your channel and I often resonate with your takes on products. But I think the Series 6 Watch, even for some Series 5 owners, can represent a substantive jump in value and performance. Let me explain.<br /><br />The quick charging capability of the Series 6 is not a small improvement. I believe it&#39;s a big step up, especially for those who use their Apple Watch for sleep tracking. The Series 6 can accept a full charge in 1.5 hours. The Series 4 and 5 and the SE take 2.5 hours. For me, that&#39;s the difference between being able to fully charge my Watch in the morning as I prepare for work and not being able to get a full charge. Also, the Series 6 has a 5Ghz WiFi radio in addition to 2.4Ghz. The Series 4 and 5 and SE only have 2.4Ghz. That can represent a substantive level of improvement when downloading rich content to the watch. The Series 6 is also the only Apple Watch with the U1 proximity chip which will likely offer upcoming functionalities  previous watches won’t. The Series 6 also has a noticably brighter and easier to see display when in its always-on mode IN BRIGHT OUTDOOR LIGHT. These are not very sexy features to talk about. But with regards to day in and day out use of the Watch, I think they need to be considered when making a decision about which Watch to buy.",Mr. Luigi,2020-10-02T23:34:08Z,0
"I picked up a series 1 when it first came out in 2016, and I finally upgraded to the SE this year. I didn’t really need the extra sensors or always on display of the 6, so I’m really happy with the SE. I think most people who upgrade are gonna be like me, coming from the series 3 or older and for those people, the SE or the 6 are gonna be great upgrades for them",Ryan DeWerff,2020-10-02T23:34:04Z,0

"This is the Most Important post you will ever read;<br /><br />Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars &amp; thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all. <br /><br />The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death &amp; hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br /><br />Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect &amp; sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, &amp; endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death &amp; rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..<br /><br />So this is what you must do in response; <br /><br />Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, &amp; through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, &amp; the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved . <br /><br />The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, &amp; also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife. <br /><br />You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br /><br />Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27);<br />‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.<br /><br />All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .",Abide,2020-10-02T23:11:51Z,1

"I&#39;m a Samsung user, but even with their watches and actual blood oxygen readers that are used in medicine, you have to be reaallly still and calm to get an accurate reading. That&#39;s just to be expected with any blood oxygen reader. From my experience working in the medical field, Samsung as well as Apple are both very accurate when conditions are met for the readings. Samsung has had this tech accessible now for at least 6 years with their phones ( up until recently ) and about 4 years or so on their watches. Apple about 4 years as well on their watches so I&#39;d hope anyways that their tech would be accurate by now lol. The new blood pressure reading functions tho? Yea, Idk bout all that yet, I wouldn&#39;t trust those readings just yet. A lot more goes into reading blood pressure accurately than most people realize. It would be amazing tech to have on you tho everywhere you go. Can and will definitely save some lives.",David Dawson,2020-10-02T23:11:13Z,0

Try the stainless steel in store (much lower amount of nickel) and see if it even touches your skin - for a lot of people the only part of the watch to touch their wrist is the sensor which is ceramic. I’ve also got a nickel allergy and I decided I’ll test it out for a few days and if I react to the steel then I’ll simply return it 🤷🏾‍♀️,N,2020-10-03T01:33:33Z,1

"The blood oxygen thing on the watch actually would have been extremely helpful when my lung collapsed a couple years ago. My lung first collapsed partially (which hurt like hell), then the doctors sent me home because my lung wasn&#39;t collapsing anymore. Then I noticed I was feeling short of breath, I was VERY close to just writing it off as just &quot;oh I&#39;m just tired&quot;, or just stressed out. I told my mom, they took me to the hospital and it turns out my lung had fully collapsed. I did not feel that full collapse. If I had the blood oxygen test conveniently on my wrist, I wouldn&#39;t have come close to writing it off. I wouldn&#39;t write something like that off as &quot;bells and whistles&quot;.<br />Edit: I know its a very particular situation but it could still save lives",Noah McBrayer,2020-10-02T22:41:23Z,1

Well what a concept alarm clock on the watch LOL yeah try the Fitbit versa two and the Fitbit versa any of those have the vibration alarms :-) and they’ve had them for years :-) way to catch up Apple :-( I’ve had all the Apple Watch is in the battery life sucks 18 hours is ridiculously pathetic for $1 trillion corporation. Fitbit nailed it by getting six days of battery life steady. Anything over five days is awesome by the way because you can get more accurate readings consistently if you wear it for five days.

"John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDamqi_3Aro&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a> (For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) The word believeth is highlighted because that&#39;s all you need to be saved, there is no other way, than to believe that Jesus came to this world to die for our sins and rose up again. In Romans 10:9 (That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.) meaning all you have to do is believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, confession is made as a proof that you believe.Don&#39;t let anyone bamboozle you into thinking that there is a special way or steps into becoming a christian the only thing to do is just to believe that&#39;s all. Believe today and you will never regret it. <br />In Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDamqi_3Aro&amp;t=6m23s"">6:23</a> (For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.) this is trying to say that once you become a christian you automatically get eternal life(making heaven) as a gift. Hell is real. But it&#39;s not the fear of hell that gets people saved. It&#39;s the gospel(believing that Jesus came to die for our sins and rose up on the third day). Fear will but produce false converts. If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” - Romans 10:9-11(NIV). There are so many benefits that come with being a christian why don&#39;t you believe in God today and see him manifest a lot of wonders in your life. Jesus is coming back again so be prepared.

"Is it just me or am I too old for this? Why would I want a watch that constantly buzzes when I get a notification? Sure, you can turn that off. But then what&#39;s the point of the thing? It can read my blood oxygen levels, neat. But not professionally so. Useless. It can detect my heartbeat. Neat... for when I&#39;m working out. Then it&#39;s a watch that cannot be upgraded and will be trash in a few years. Granted, it&#39;s Apple, so it&#39;ll have a 5 or 6-year lifespan. But still, it&#39;ll become trash in a few years. Oh yes, it can show the time. I don&#39;t care about the time being on my wrist. It&#39;s on my phone and on my laptop and on my PC and pretty much everywhere I need one (public transport) there are clocks all over the place. <br /><br />I&#39;d like to want an Apple Watch, but I&#39;d fail to see a useful application for it in daily life. If only it came with a fingerprint scanner built-in, then it could unlock my MBP instead of having to always open the lid to access that feature. Oh, also: APPLE!

"A year ago my girlfriend was hit by a car.<br /><br />Doctors told her that she&#39;d never regain her feeling from her waist and down she&#39;d never be able to walk again.<br /><br />Physically and mentally it was hard for both of us, she needed more care than ever.<br /><br />Roughly two months ago she told me that<br />she was sorry she couldn&#39;t statisfy me, and that I could go see other women and have sex with them instead I asked her to marry me.<br /><br />She smiled but told me that she didn&#39;t want to get married in a wheelchair, therefore she&#39;d marry me the day she could walk as reply I told her I&#39;d stay with her till that day.<br /><br />Three days ago, as I was making her breakfast, I suddenly heard the door from the bedroon open. <br />There she was, the love of my life, standing on her feet, taking every little step with caution.<br /><br />We&#39;re getting married next mnonth.<br /><br />Just wanted to let you know that miracles actually do happen, so don&#39;t loose your faith!<br /><br /><br />If you enjoy the comment plz do<br />&quot;savscribe&quot;to my channel..,<br />I know I had written wrong spelling<br />But YouTube don&#39;t allow promotion.,<br />So do &quot;SAVSCRIVE&quot;<br />It takes only 5 seconds, thank you.<br />I made short videos.<br />Daily 1 Video<br />1 minute longer.<br />Like this story 💯<br />Click on my pic.<br /><br />[If you don&#39;t want to do sub*****e, so it&#39;s OK<br />but don&#39;t spread hate V<br />&lt;Have a nice day. 😌<br />vbn",Rehan Malik,2020-10-02T21:54:35Z,1
