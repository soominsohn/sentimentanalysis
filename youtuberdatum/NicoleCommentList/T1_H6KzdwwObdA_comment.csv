I haven&#39;t used the ben nye is a long time but i used to use the banana one n i used to use an empty compact (it was a cover girl pressed powder that had broke) i cleaned it  out n used to use it for applying loose powders n things like that..just pour the amount of loose powder u think u will need in there n u when u are done clean it out n u are good to go! Plus i liked using it bc it had a mirror so when i was setting my uneer eyes or whatever i hady mirror n powder roght there in my hand! Thankfully the setting powder i have now has a big enough lid that i can just use that lol,Leelee Cee,2020-01-22T17:01:48Z,1
