We’re literally the same person! My love for my three cats is intense and I also love feeding birds and squirrels. There’s a park in my town that I go to every weekend and I feed the chickadees sunflower seeds and I feed the squirrels walnuts. They are so tame the birds will land in your hand and the squirrels will run up to you and take the nuts from your hand. I also joke that I’m Snow White! LOVE YOUR VLOGS!   🐿 🥜 🐈 🇨🇦❤️,"My Life, Tho",2020-12-11T02:25:32Z,0

"Our nail techs just use a small piece of cotton soaked in acetone and then place it on the nail and wrap in foil. They’ve also used the nail clips which are way easier when doing it yourself, they just take a little longer.

"Pro nail tech. here, gel polish likes sticky or rough surfaces. Your peeling likely happened cause you applied your second color right on top of your first color.  My advice? Order go time from young nails. It&#39;s one coat application in a gel polish  bottle application but is hard gel. Sooo easy, fast full coverage, thin but very strong. Great on natural nails that are kinda wrecked 😁 I have a you tube channel I&#39;m just starting with a ton of info about nails if you would like to follow me. It&#39;s under my name.

As long as you abrase the top coat first the foil technique will work in 10-15 minutes. Soak tiny pieces of cotton pad in 100% acetone then apply to nails and wrap in foil. Check after 10 minutes and use a cuticle pusher to gently scrape away the gel polish. You may need to reapply for another 10 minutes but gel polish should definitely not take any longer cx,Michelle Harrison,2020-05-18T10:39:24Z,0
