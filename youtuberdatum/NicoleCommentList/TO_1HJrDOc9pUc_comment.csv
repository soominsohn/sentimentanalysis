"Botox kills expression and turns people into stone-faced mannequins. Is looking wrinkle-free THAT important? So important that you will eventually become nothing more than a moving mouth? On another note: your boobs are fine. Pretty much what others aspire to WITH surgery. Please don&#39;t feel pressured to change something about yourself. I have big boobs too, and that&#39;s ok. Then there&#39;s the fact that with a reduction comes devastating scars and the possibility of nerve damage and necrosis to the nipple(s). It happened to my mother and she was devastated to discover they could not save one of her nipples. At that point, the realization of one&#39;s choice to have that reduction will become something they will regret to no end.",The Raw Egg Files,2019-05-24T15:31:36Z,0

"Seriously girl I have the worst teeth! My teeth like yours are like chalk they are so soft. At this point I&#39;ve spent $30,000 on crowns porcelain crowns and three implants. I have to say that if you&#39;re in Los Angeles ask your doctor if your veneers are coming from DaVinci labs. Because my porcelain crowns on my front top teeth look real, and when I say real I mean real. It&#39;s crazy. DaVinci is only in California and I live in Texas  but my dentist  only uses  them . they used to do all of the teeth for the show The Swan. If you&#39;re old enough to remember it, they would take women and do complete makeovers on them. I hope things go well and I know that with your experience the dentist probably isn&#39;t as scary as it is for most people.",jemma28,2019-01-29T18:18:08Z,0

"I wish everyone would just leave their faces alone. Started watching YouTube for makeup tutorials, because I was awful at makeup. It’s now become a saturated “keeping up with the Jones’s” and fake beauty ideals. Makes me sad. I realize I’m probably the only one who feels like this, but it’s a shame all of these YouTubers are unhappy with their natural features.",Jenny Sena,2019-01-25T05:13:21Z,209
"I think getting fillers that suit YOUR face is great if the person wants it, but I agree that many people do it to the point that they all look the same. I also understand preventive botox, but you have to be careful with that obvi too. I think (yes, very subjective) Nicole didn&#39;t need the cheek fillers at all, but I think the jaw filler actually compliments her face shape. I don&#39;t understand why someone would like to do a whole new feature on their face, like someone with really thin lips wants to change their entire lips to look like someone else&#39;s. The best work is that you yourself can see, and feel better because of it, but other people don&#39;t actually really even notice, like getting modest lip fillers that suit your face, so it still looks like you. To me that is the same as makeup, it&#39;s you but &quot;improved&quot; (if that is what you want to see on yourself). I wish everyone would think about themselves as individuals and try to see their unique features as something that is beautiful and only compliment those features, and not try to create entirely new ones (Nose job so the new nose doesn&#39;t even remotely resemble your old nose, fillers to sculpt entirely new cheek bones)",beebikinis,2019-05-23T13:56:24Z,1

@LeAnn Navarrette 31 is young.  She&#39;s talking about a wrinkle I can&#39;t see.  I&#39;m 44 and am only just starting to think if I notice any lines I&#39;m not happy with I might consider by 45 but I&#39;m noticing good skincare makes them disappear (superficial surface lines you see appearing can be starting just from dehydration to the skin) so I&#39;ve held off. Maybe because it&#39;s Florida it&#39;s harsher weather over there. What is wrong with her jawline? She looks perfect to me even before she ever did fillers I&#39;ve thought so.,MishMila016,2019-03-28T16:02:21Z,3

She did enter to win one of your 15 boxes of ten pound makeup and I have never seen her try so hard at something in her life. She loves makeup even tho she somehow can’t get makeup to stay on her nose as it seems to slip off through out the day. If you have any suggestions on she can’t get her makeup game on fleek and not slip off that’d be great!  She is upset that didn’t win the box but has promised me that next time you do the ten pound box of makeup that she will give me two products from it, so I mean if you could hook a girl up I’d appreciate it 👊👊",Katelyn Dufour,2019-01-24T04:30:20Z,0

@Laura Teasley really? I was informed by a dermatologist that fillers can slow down ageing as it stimulates collagen production where ever it is injected. interesting to know that were being fed different information,Cha Kaur,2019-06-26T20:06:50Z,0

"You’re probably new to her channel. Her dark circles were BAD. She needed under eye filler. Now the other stuff she probably didn’t need but that’s what happens with plastic surgery, you just keep getting more and more.",jae ent,2019-03-08T19:56:30Z,0

I get Botox in my forehead to prevent wrinkles and was told it would help in aging process but I was informed the opposite when it comes to fillers because once the filler breaks down there is a chance of loose skin. This was by a dermatologist,Laura Teasley,2019-03-04T02:00:00Z,3

I love watching your vlogs. I look forward to your vlogs. I had really bad teeth as well. I’m so self conscious about my teeth. Last year I lost all my teeth and I’m only 42 but I always looked younger. And now my self esteem is on the floor because I have full dentures. I wish I could have afford to get implants and teeth that look more natural instead of looking like a grandma. My lips used to look fuller now the whole shape of my face looks so different... thanks for talking about it I thought I was the only one with bad teeth. Love you Nicole,Anie Velez,2019-01-23T15:20:31Z,5

Face looks great! Careful wearing heavy sunnies on your cheeks for a couple of weeks afterwards. I’d also ask your injector what she thinks of aspirating to check if she’s in a blood vessel when injecting the filler - I usually use a cannula which is a bit safer and way less painful 🙌,Melanie CLIQUET,2019-01-23T11:06:36Z,0

"DON&#39;T GET A BRIDGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Research and get an implant, it&#39;s a bit more money but it&#39;ll be a good investment. Especially if you get cavities easily or whatever you have going on with your teeth. If you end up having a cavity form under the bridge you&#39;ll have to take the whole bridge off, get rid of the cavity  then re do the whole thing and it can get costly.when I gotten my tooth implant, it went by pretty easy! It wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought it&#39;d be. I hope this was helpful for you 🙂🙂🥰",Angelina Rose,2019-01-23T08:53:46Z,2

@Edith Mendez oh wow. That is good to know for the future! It seems like a lot but good dental health is important. Thank you! 🙋‍,Theresa G.,2019-01-28T05:15:11Z,1
Theresa G. No you still have to brush you teach oral hygiene is very important but I would switch to a super soft / soft toothbrush to prevent microscopic scratches if you decide to get your teeth done. But the process is preparing the teeth meaning they would take tooth structure ( enamel) the top layer of your teeth in a sense making the more pron to sensitivity and sometimes brittle . And having to avoid some food that are too hard to crunch on when taking the first bites . But to each their own always do your research. But I were to do it I would got with full crowns made from zirconium they done new improvements which is much stronger than porcelain.,Edith Mendez,2019-01-28T04:25:26Z,1

"Every person that I’ve known in the YouTube world always gets something done, either with the face, boobs, stomach, butt, they get so influenced by today’s standard of what they call “beauty” ... it’s so sad..",A V,2019-02-07T19:21:13Z,4
I have to agree.,Ashley G,2019-01-29T17:07:17Z,4
"Leann Navarrette - I never said for her not to get those injections. I’m only saying is not a cool thing to do because it is a superficial snd ugly standard of beauty (pretty much mostly popular in LA and Florida). It is not just a matter of personal taste. Those injections in the face eventually would make anyone look like a monster, because it is well known that those injections are pretty addictive for majority of people that uses them. Just look at Mickey Rourke, lol. <br />You don’t need to agree with my statement, but you do not need to put words in my mouth. Unfortunately for you, other people are also entitled to their opinion. Especially when someone is posting in public for others to see those artificial changes on their face. Grown up, public people, don’t need minions to defend them when they do stupid stuff. And this was pretty stupid. Just have in mind everyone watching is not a dumb person.",Florecita,2019-01-29T02:20:18Z,13
"@Florecita Shes a grown woman and she can do as she pleases. Theres no problem with wanting to look like the best version of yourself in YOUR eyes. That&#39;s the real message to take from it, not that insecure girls will want to change their whole face. She still is barefaced a lot of the time so whoever believes she doesnt like her face they&#39;re mistaken. She is still young enough that her fillers are just preventing wrinkles not filling up deep wrinkles so it&#39;s not as dramatic.",LeAnn Navarrette,2019-01-28T15:50:09Z,14

"Hi girl I’m going to give you my honest opinion. I’m dental assist with experience of 22 years, I have 8 veneers on the top and my natural teeth on the bottom. There’s few things you need to know. Make sure you Align your teeth with braces as necessary because your bite has to be perfect to support any dental work. Bleach your teeth and make sure that you stop the bleaching at least a week before they prepare your teeth for veneers. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE!!! Of choosing a shade “color” too light because you are going to be force to bleach the rest of your teeth pretty often to make them match with the veneers,got my point? And I know you like coffee. When you prep teeth for veneer the front and the side have to be reduced in order to look natural. There is thing that you are not going to be able to eat why because they are a thin layer of porcelain they can fracture,they can come loose-with time/years but they can look amazing!!!! If you would like to com6act me feel free I can show mines. Do a Lot of research first and get more than one opinion.",judy rodriguez,2019-01-23T01:24:28Z,60
"If u go on her IG u can see a couple pic in like sept 18 where u can clearly see she has clear braces, so i guess thats why? She was fixing her bite before getting her veneers? Thats why i couldnt understand how she had a gap all the sudden but then when i went to get invisalign they like shaved between my teeth making lil spaces(gaps) for my teeth to move, but they also do that for veneers, so that must be why she had the gap all the sudden, i couldnt figure that out, so thanks for clearing that up! Like u said alot of dr are all about the money so they just slap veneers on, so least u know he is a good dentist if he made her wear braces first he was worried about her bite!",Ashley Atwell,2019-06-15T20:08:23Z,0
judith rodriguez I Agee with you I don’t think taking more tooth structure in prepping the teeth if her “enamel is weak” making them MORE WEAK she souls go with a more conservative outreach! Because not all dentist in the industry are honest especially with the pt is full forward in doing 2 sets of veneers! THATS A LOT OF MONEY and that’s what I think the dr could just be after and not the actual care of the pt . <br />Mades me wonder if she really needed those Rt canals .,Edith Mendez,2019-01-28T04:10:54Z,3
Tenille Mcwatters no you need to beach your teeth first and  stop a week before you prep your teeth for veneers in order match the color. It’s very important not to go lighter than your teeth other wise you have to bleach the rest of your teeth every other month to match your veneers,judy rodriguez,2019-01-26T05:52:36Z,0
"But once you whiten them, will the veneers look darker?? I think she keeps her teeth whitened",Tenille Mcwatters,2019-01-25T23:08:34Z,0
"CcoronaS  Yes it is very pricey. They don’t last for ever like any dental work or anything else, you have to be very careful with what you put in your mouth lol in a good way. But like everything else depends on the situation they have policy for replacements as needed you know. Again yes it is pricey but way better than bondings they discolor with time. Thank you so much for you comments I appreciated!!!",judy rodriguez,2019-01-25T18:37:43Z,1

Disturbing... I cannot emphasize enough how much you &quot;Influencers&quot; are causing as young as elementary aged girls to have low self-esteem!!! Why why why do women need to promote having three people injecting stuff into your face to look beautiful???? So disappointing to see what women feel like they have to do to themselves to feel confident nowadays 😭 I am a teacher so trust me when I say young girls ARE WATCHING THESE MAKEUP VIDEOS and critiquing themselves like never before,Nicole B,2019-01-22T22:41:31Z,0

"Orangie is SO adorable all bundled up with you. He is SO cute. I really like cats. My uncle has a cute Calico named Cesar...he is so adorable. I am also a major dog person. I am so considered about the fillers, Nicole. No judgement or shade. Please be extra careful. I am SO happy and stoked to see this new vlog. I know you are so busy and what not. HOPE to see more vlogs and more often. I also HOPE you keep your hair dark like this...so fly on you. You look really young however when your hair is like this you look like a teen no joke. I want to see you get your nails done from start to finish and maybe introduce your manicurist. See you get a pedicure too...that would be a total blast. Could you go jewelry shopping sometime? You have excellent taste...that would be dope to see. Is Carli going to come to FL for a visit soon? You and Carli are really fun together. How is it going with your pin line with Jeremy? I bet really well. No brainier! Thanks for such a long vlog and just vlog period. That was such a lovely, heartfelt trip for your mom, awe. Sorry about all your kitchen issues. I went through a bit of a problem with my disposal and then a few other pop up...the domino effect. It would be really cool to see you and Jeremy go to Costco...that would be awesome. Dental pain worries me SO much. SORRY you went through that. I think you have great teeth. All the best in 2019!",MotherHen007,2019-01-22T04:13:15Z,1

ayaros x I work for a periodontist so we specialize in implants and the success rate is very high (96% I think) given that you go to someone who specializes in periodontics titanium is actually one the more compatible materials and integrates with the bone extremely well... in the case of implant failure the implant is removed and the site is allowed to heal,Nikki Smyth,2019-01-24T01:59:34Z,0

"Hi girl I love ur videos but I was hearing you say about getting a bridge. I’m no dentist for sure but I am a dental assistant and I’m not putting it in stone or anything but your still young. I would maybe do some research about getting an implant if ur bone levels are good :). Cleaning is way easier and it functions like a normal tooth. It does take a little longer in time to have a tooth placed just cuz of healing purposes but it will last u the rest of ur life. Bridges are great to but you have to thread under them to keep them clean, plus u can still get decay on the root surfaces. Just thought I would put that out there!!!

That’s what helped me stop complaining, the thought came by itself all of a sudden lol",Esthella Marie Mrs. Cardenas,2019-01-22T02:55:54Z,0
