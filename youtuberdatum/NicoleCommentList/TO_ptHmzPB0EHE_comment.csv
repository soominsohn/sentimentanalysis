Okkkrrrrrtttt but can you do a video guiding and tips to purchasing on eBay or the The Real ?! 😭😩 #143,Mary J,2019-05-17T18:25:22Z,68
M J the real real has a team of luxury experts that verify authenticity before the product is put up for sale. Any purchase above $500 on poshmark is sent for authentication prior to delivery. On eBay you just have to trust your knowledge. eBay does a great job of ridding bad sellers from the platform but if you don’t know how to tell if a bag is authentic you can get taken. eBay has buyer protection tho so you have like 30-45 days to open a return for a full refund. Plenty of time to research what you have bought. I’m an eBay &amp; posh buyer/seller &amp; have bought high end goods without any issues.,Alicia Stewart,2019-05-23T13:59:07Z,2

Although since I heard about these guys making a comeback I guess in the last year or so, but definitely takes me back when I used to wear them when I was in junior high. My daughter who’s almost thirteen has one too and she loved using it. As for the air pods.
