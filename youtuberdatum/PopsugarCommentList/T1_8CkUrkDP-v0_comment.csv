"If you are here to learn how to box or kickbox, this workout is not for you. This is definitely not beginner level. She doesn&#39;t really teach you form or how the move works. She goes super fast and doesn&#39;t give you the time or the teaching to learn the moves. I do wish she would have gone over more form instead of talking about random things. If you&#39;re already advanced enough or if you like this style, go for it! But this workout is not for me at all.",Carissa Pennington,2021-02-20T22:41:37Z,0
"Christa your kickboxing exercises are so amazing...I usually wear a fitbit and track my heart rate while exercising. But when I do your videos, I forget to keep track and by the time I am done, I realise I have burnt way more calories  than I imagined because it all looked so fun and easy. Today when I did this video, it was so strange, as I was repeating after you towards the end &quot;I am strong&quot; and other affirmations, I felt so overwhelmed and tears cam eout of my eyes for no reason. I guess we all have those days when we feel vulnerable. Thank you.",Shweta Thampan,2021-02-20T04:44:59Z,0

"I fell in love with Christa&#39;s workout after the three last breaths in cooldown. I take them as an oath to myself. As a person who has suffered from anorexia as well as bulimia (and probably a lot more undiagnosed problems) that ted talk about the why just spoke to me so much.

"I would classify this as an &quot;advanced&quot; kickboxing workout.  As Christa dives right into the workout with a shorter warm-up, this workout can be a little frustrating for beginners who have not been introduced to the four core punches of boxing.  I have done Christa&#39;s other Popsugar Fitness classes, and have managed to master those ones, but this one I find to be more fast-paced with shorter demo times.  So if you haven&#39;t done any of Christa&#39;s classes before, do the longer workouts where she takes more time to demo the moves before attempting this one.",Yvonne Tsui,2020-06-10T22:29:42Z,0

Thank you for the workout. Thank you for also mentioning how exercise helps with anxiety. iI it wasn&#39;t for exercise I probably would never be able to calm down! And it really is a struggle. Thank you also for the end! I couldn&#39;t even speak the words but I mouthed them! Going through these scary times it can be hard to say those things or when you feel frightened! I appreciate this and you all :),Smoog,2020-03-29T18:02:27Z,2

Day 4: My legs and booty still hurts😂 been struggling to walk,Alejandra Yunuen,2020-03-14T04:29:58Z,3
This whole work out was so INSPIRING! I had a cold 2 weeks ago and haven’t gotten back in my normal workout routine. I didn’t see the point and couldn’t find my WHY. I noticed that every day I was usually tired and a little negative. This workout and these girls helped me find my why and helped me feel stronger than I have been. Thank you popsugar fitness.,caychats 96,2020-03-14T02:24:26Z,2

I can only hope that christa or popsugar sees this....I have been doing all the Cut workouts and this one now- anything with Christa - I love her energy and real-ness. I’m obsessed with her and I need more of her!!! Her workouts help me with my anxiety and all the life s*** that is going on. So I’m so appreciative of her and all of her workouts and I hope one day I can afford either the cut or boxing and bubbles. Thank you christa and popsugar,Sarah,2020-03-13T17:03:50Z,23

I lost 80 lbs last year and it all started with me doing christa&#39;s popsugar videos until I had them memorized and then I added on  boxing and bubbles and I loved it. Not only are the workouts great but I love her personality and her positive energy is contagious. You better believe I&#39;d give her a bear hug if I ever met her in person.,Diana,2020-03-10T00:06:15Z,195

@Ifunanya Anikamadu That&#39;s true. Tbh I end up adding extra intensity to the dance workouts wherever I can. (For instance doing star jumps instead of jumping jacks) It makes for a more HIIT- like workout. I&#39;d recommend trying that on days where you feel like dancing but also want to satisfy that part of your mind that says it wants to get a &quot;Great workout&quot;.,Maya Tanner,2020-03-09T22:08:55Z,1
Maya Tanner I have definitely tried them! I like them but I don’t get the same effects as workouts like these. Plus they aren’t as long either.,Ifunanya Anikamadu,2020-03-09T21:23:13Z,3
