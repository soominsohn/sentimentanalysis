Why is anything is titled Barre when there actually is not a barre in the workout. Call is Pilates or whatever it is; it is not barre. The purpose of barre is to be able to do exercises that you can not add the range of motion without holding to it. Saying Barre Inspired is just misleading; yet at least it could be put into the title of the video. This is not a barre workout; no matter how much your barre certification tried to sell it to you without doing it on the barre.,Nilay Engin,2021-01-26T20:05:10Z,0

"I find that a lot of short workout videos are super intense and jam-packed because I think the premise is that viewers only have 10 min to workout that day, which is fine, but that&#39;s personally not what I&#39;m looking for. So that&#39;s why I loved this video, and I also loved Marnie&#39;s energy and attitude. This workout was actually a lot of fun to do, and despite having a sore lower back the day after, I will be doing this again!",Emily T.,2020-05-30T05:46:42Z,2
