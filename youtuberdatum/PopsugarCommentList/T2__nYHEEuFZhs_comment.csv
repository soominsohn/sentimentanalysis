The whole point of counting down is to count down!!!  And he takes breaks ALL the time walking around pretending to check out the girl&#39;s form - when he&#39;s just catching his own breath!  TWIT!

That guy&#39;s bs counting really ticked me off.,Miranda Jones,2021-04-07T16:57:26Z,0
"Although all the moves were simplistic, non-impact and fine, the instructor loses all trust and credibility  when he stops doing the workout multiple times on non-intensive moves...then likes to joke with the count and length of each count hold on almost every exercise. It was like a frat boy decided to do a class to be around chicks. Again, it would be one thing if he stopped doing the workout for a second to “coach” and catch his breath during back to back burpees and squat jumps...but this guy takes a breather during simple squat holds and planks.  He lost total trainer credibility at that point.",Tiffany Walker,2021-04-02T16:24:50Z,0

The instructor should always stay with the exercise instead of walking around criticizing the other team members. It feels like he can&#39;t keep up with the routine.,keiko moriyama,2021-03-23T16:00:11Z,0

"Love this workout. It&#39;s short, works up a sweat and my muscles burn!<br />I keep this in my regular rotation, also love that I can do this one late at night without thumping around on the floor waking up the family:) <br />Keep the great workout videos coming!",Mahriah Delaney,2021-03-04T03:40:01Z,0
"Deff made me sweat and a good variety of moves, but I didn&#39;t like the flow of moves or the pace. If your looking for a low impact routine because of your knees, this is not for you. I also had to modify a ton of the moves because if I went at the pace they did I could hurt myself. Also as others have said the fake out counting is annoying.",Francesca Canepa,2021-03-01T15:42:56Z,0
"I&#39;ve watched many videos on this channel and it struck me how sexist this one feels: A Male instructor doing half of the workout when all other female instructors on this channel do the whole workout.

"I&#39;ve tried doing Lit Method a couple of times and I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s for me. I&#39;m not a fan in general when instructors give you &quot;fake time&quot; (ex: &quot;5..4... 3... 3... 3....&quot;) but I can do with a couple times The instructor here did it nearly every move and I frankly find it infuriating. If you tell me at the beginning it&#39;s only ten seconds, then keep it ten seconds! Don&#39;t switch up on me, telling me for 30 more seconds. I lose all motivation.",Rebecca Raeta,2021-02-12T17:07:30Z,0

I would have liked this work out but the instructor kept lying about how long things were accounting ridiculously out of order. It is not funny.

This was one of the more intense PopSugar workout&#39;s I have done. My apple watch said I burnt 294 calories doing this. I have a feeling the after-burn will be a lot greater on this video since this was more strength/resistance than some of the more cardio based workouts.

"The worst Popsugar Fitness workout ever. This instructor is the worst, some of us program our mind to do reps and we keep going coz of the countdown and so everytime he pauses or repeats a rep countdown without for-warning us is just so destructive and demotivating.

I loved this workout! I love that he tells us to go slow and focus on form and control rather than going as fast as you can.

"We gave up so many times during the workout. First he stopped so many times which makes you even wonder why he keeps pushing you when he&#39;s not showing an example. Seconds not counting accurately and not telling you for how long to plank is horrible, if I know I have a minute to hold I will. If I hold for 40 sec and there&#39;s no finish line I&#39;ll give up. Plus all of his squat holds and one leg forever holds are definitely not for the average person, nobody can make it entirely without giving up a few times. Not a realistic workout.",Jeremy N.,2020-10-18T16:14:15Z,0

Sometimes instructors keep counting and sow down their counting just to push you. They do it. Doesn&#39;t mean you have to slow down. Obviously they are towards the end. Just do the workout and if you quit because of the counting you would have quitted anyway.,Anna Maria,2020-08-28T09:42:53Z,2

"I&#39;ve been doing popsugar workouts for nearly 6 months in quarantine, and I usually do the longer ones (45 mins). However this workout was extremely challenging and made me sweat more than some of those hour long ones. It really burned! I used a mini band on my thighs for an extra challenge and I couldn&#39;t believe how much my muscles burned in just 25 minutes! I will be saving this one to do again.",Juliana Bastidas C,2020-08-26T23:17:17Z,3
