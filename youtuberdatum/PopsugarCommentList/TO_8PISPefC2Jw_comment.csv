I really like Déjà but this workout was a huge letdown. I am not in good shape but it was way too easy and I was really bored. Even on a “light” day it wasn’t worth the time- my Fitbit didn’t even recognize that it was a workout 😕,andrea sell,2021-04-19T11:51:24Z,0

I&#39;ve really enjoyed this workout so much I&#39;ve been doing it every morning for a week.  It wasn&#39;t until the 4th time that I can honestly say I had the choreo down...And I&#39;m proud of myself because the first time I saw it I found it inconceivable that it would be possible to do the choreo that fast!  But I did it!  Yayyy.  I love these dance workouts and I look forward to doing them all!  Sadly I cannot get lavender yogi stress relief tea here in India...but the thought of drinking it is calming. :D,Frances Darwin,2019-12-22T03:28:08Z,2

"Don&#39;t eat ice-cream &amp; wear pjs all day when depressed, instead watch THIS video &amp; Deja brightening our lives! &lt;3 ^_^",Divya G.,2019-12-09T14:43:06Z,1
Divya G. Awww so sweet ☺️💜✨ I must say I also love a day in PJs with a scoop of my fave ice cream but a cup of tea &amp; a good workout make me feel even better 🌟,Deja Riley,2019-12-10T02:49:10Z,1
"Maybe it&#39;s just me but I found that one a bit odd. Strange music and moves with a lot of slow parts, and then having to run to get a mat for like 3 mins of abs randomly in the middle. These girls make it look good but it certainly didn&#39;t look good when I did it and nor was it much of a workout sadly.",Alexandra Panico,2019-12-09T12:14:06Z,59
you quit too early. this is a KILLER workout,flyperson1,2020-10-03T22:53:34Z,0
"For me this is kind of embarrassing, like what moves were we doing?? I quit after five minutes, not cause it was hard, cause i found it stupid",Jacquelyn,2020-09-17T16:51:26Z,0
I think this is more for people who dont workout much and want to move a little bit. I wouldnt do this to lose weight or gain muscle,Enn Vee,2020-03-31T20:04:57Z,1
Yeah I felt the pace in the first half was kind of slow and then BAM I got hit with the 5 minutes of crunches LOL,Ko Ko,2020-03-31T01:39:57Z,2
Alexandra Panico I think this ones more for beginners!,Delaney,2020-01-26T21:05:50Z,3
