Good exercise. Would have liked it to be unisex since I am a dude doing it and felt a little weird being told to put on the lace gloves and dress lol. I really liked the air guitar and mosh pit.,alfabdall,2020-01-12T15:55:07Z,1

Please bring back regular workouts more often! Not everyone likes dance workouts and I think you are losing the interest of A LOT of your fan base/viewers.

"This was really cute! I like the whole through the decades idea. It seemed more of a low-impact dance workout, vs something high energy so it was nice for me because I wasn&#39;t looking for anything crazy today.

Cute and everything but its another dance workout. Which tbh I&#39;m not a huge fan of.
