"I&#39;ll admit this workout completely killed me. Right now I only workout 2x every week and I&#39;m trying to increase that gradually. I tried sticking with the advanced and wow did I feel that afterwards. This is one of the toughest I&#39;ve had to do, considering I&#39;m more of a runner, but I would so recommend this to others!

"This is great! But does she know what a second is?? i feel like the circuits were rushed, and then when she started counting it was really fast, much faster than a second. She&#39;s very talented and in great shape, so I trust her a lot!

"Great workout! Definitely an intermediate level- I consider myself pretty fit and I had to change up to lighter weights for the second circuit rounds. As other posters have said- definitely more of an upper body focus, but I love the compound movements that target multiple areas. I had to pause a few times to watch the instructor do the moves, unfortunately there wasn&#39;t time allotted to a demo. However it&#39;s a workout I will do many times in the future to build up my strength. Thanks so much!",mathesonk10,2021-01-17T16:59:18Z,0

"@Eumorphia Artemiou Theres a lot of pushups in this workout and since I&#39;m a beginner and can&#39;t do full pushups yet, i&#39;d say its not for beginners haha. But there are the modified versions that I followed for some of the workouts and i think they work pretty well. I&#39;m aiming to be able to do full pushups by the end of this year. Wish me luck!",MEI XUAN LER,2021-04-09T13:35:32Z,1

"Just some constructive criticism, I thought the warmup was far too intense too quick. I felt my quad strain as I jumped back up from the pushup since I wasn&#39;t adequately warmed up and not ready for something so explosive.",Kelsey B,2020-06-25T13:40:26Z,0
"I have to agree with some people here who are saying that the pauses were not long enough and sometimes I couldn&#39;t follow because it went to fast. I was very confused by the counting too...sometimes she counted down actual seconds and sometimes she just went so fast while counting. It was confusing. Apart from that I liked the workout and I&#39;m sure, if you do it multiple times, you will see results. I will not be doing that because I&#39;m sick of comments like &quot;we build a summer body in the winter&quot;. Fat people have summer bodies too and it&#39;s a disturbing message that only helps diet culture. Do better.",Rebekka K,2020-06-24T08:16:15Z,0

Personally, I felt the moves were slow and controlled enough that it wasn&#39;t hard to follow/understand at all. My point being -- give it a shot. Great workout.",68flyersfan,2020-05-22T09:05:04Z,0

"I&#39;ve done a ton of POPSUGAR workouts while in quarantine (and typically love all of them) and I am in pretty good shape but this one is just okay. Each section basically only worked one muscle (not muscle group, muscle) so by the second or third exercise your muscle is so completely tired that you can&#39;t even continue. My arms are going to be absolutely dead tomorrow but I wish I felt as though I got more of a total body workout or could alternate muscle groups so that my exhausted muscles could rest and get breaks. The video wasn&#39;t as energetic as I&#39;m used to with POPSUGAR.

There should be a side by side view of how your posture should be when lifting weights bent over. I dont know if I am lifting correctly. I think I&#39;ve damaged my back,Renee80A,2020-01-22T08:46:10Z,0

She followed now cues and when Ingrid explained what not to do, she would continue doing it wrong.  It actually made the workout better as i just watched her and it is hilarious. The woman doing the &#39;modified&#39; exercises did great and should of been doing the full exercises and gave modified to purple girl.  Looks like she is new to working out but she should pay more attention to the instructor.  Watch and enjoy!  Great comedy....",Kersten Herold,2019-08-30T12:53:41Z,0

"How many calories burned tho...I love this video am currently doing it twice a week, what I’ve loved about past Popsugar vids is when I’ve done them they always told me the approximate calories burned now I can’t find it. I track my workouts and food and it’s frustrating to not have an idea of the amount of calories burned. My suggestion is to add that back to the descriptions.",Tanya Fields,2019-08-25T17:24:30Z,6
"Sarah R Well the one I have reminds me to keep moving so that I don’t just sit around all day ^^;. I am not sure how accurate the calorie counter is (I think this is a problem that all trackers would face through) but I find it nice that it tracks my heart rate and the number of steps. I think they quite are, or at least the one I have has been beneficial to me ^^",Little Wolf,2020-05-19T05:53:11Z,0
"Tanya Fields I know this is a pretty old comment, but wouldn’t it be quite difficult to write a number of calories burned? I mean, that number can vary a lot depending on the intensity at which you worked out, the amount of lean mass vs adipose that makes up your body, your age, height, how used you are to working out, wether you are male or female and so on. So if anything, I think “calories burned” would be more like a particularly wide range of numbers that you could only use to approximate and even then it might not be accurate ^^; (not trying to be demotivating, but due to my small build I burn less than 200 in workouts that tell me I’ll be burning 600, just to give you an example)",Little Wolf,2020-04-15T08:05:57Z,0

"DO NOT ARCH YOUR LOWER BACK IN A DEADLIFT. I repeat do not arch your lower back in a deadlift. The proper form is to keep your back straight from your head to back while lowering the weights along your legs and only going as far down as you feel a tug in your hamstrings (which is different for everyone, could be above or below the knee). Then use your exhale to squeeze your glutes to come up to standing.",Stevanie Mead,2019-08-22T07:13:46Z,1

"I&#39;ve been doing this workout for a couple months now on days when I can&#39;t make it to the gym. It&#39;s an excellent full body workout! Ingrid is an amazing instructor and such an inspiration because she is so strong! I didn&#39;t realize until reading the comments that it may be best suited for folks who can pick up combinations fast and who already have a sense of what their form should be doing basic exercises like lunges, squats, push-ups, etc. If that&#39;s not the case for you, i think you might have to pause and rewind and pay close attention to how the exercises are being done. But if you already have that basic knowledge, jump in and get a great workout!!!!",daniel goodman,2019-08-14T07:50:24Z,0

As others pointed out, it was a bit hard to follow bc you had little time to understand the exercise and do it. But this actually helped in focusing 100% and never lose it: it takes you out of your comfort zone you ain’t got no time to think!! Just do it!! And when you believe you’re done and you can’t hold it anymore, the instructor brings out that motivation kick that makes you carry on. I recommend it 👌🏻",queenie cox,2019-05-24T08:39:46Z,17

"I&#39;m very torn on how I feel about this workout. This was actually a surprisingly good weights workout in terms of hitting a lot of muscle groups, with some plyo for cardio mixed in. I really need to work on holding that sumo squat and squat jumps. However, I didn&#39;t like the instructor. She lacked consistency with form, didn&#39;t instruct well, and didn&#39;t explain what muscles should be hit and when (I know, but for a beginner it&#39;s key). This really felt like a workout you could only do well with if you&#39;ve already done it once. She also moved way to fast for the kind of weighted movements being done. For her, those might be super light weights and she can toss the around, for a beginner they could hurt themselves trying to keep up. <br />So I think I&#39;ll try it again to test my improvement. I&#39;d love more PopSugar weight training, but better instruction.",Brianna Edgerley-Dallal,2019-03-14T11:56:02Z,19

"The first time I did this workout I hated it too. Felt the same way! Now it&#39;s my favorite. When an instructor goes too fast, I think trying it again with a much lighter set of weights helps.

"For me, an ex- and future trainer, this workout was infuriating. The moves are complex, and the instructor (a pleasant and engaging personality, and attractive as well) isn&#39;t given sufficient time to demonstrate the moves before the participant needs to start the exercise. <br />A side note: if a participant does Circuit 2 properly, they should not have sufficient stability left in their biceps to do the final move (a move that would be difficult in a plyometrics-specific workout routine) properly. Life and exercise are a series of trade-offs.<br />That will being said, I look forward to more videos from the trainer. I don&#39;t live in CA, so I can&#39;t realistically take one of her classes live.",Max,2019-01-29T12:52:38Z,0
"Excellent, quick but intense HIIT strength work out, really a bang for your time. I will most def add this to my rotation, especially on busy days. Trainer has a balanced and positive energy without even trying too hard. HIIT format does not allow time to elaborate on form, but aims to quickly transition from one to another move and keep the heart rate elevated so the criticisms are a bit unfair.  I liked her vibe , her strong, extremely fit body is a healthy inspiration for a lot of naturally thicker built girls out there. This is an intermediate level workout w 8 or 10 pound dumbbells, probably more suitable for a moderately seasoned exerciser. Would like to see more of similar HIIT strength routines this year from you, guys.",KBunny13,2019-01-29T11:35:22Z,0

"Definitely worked up a sweat, but agree with many others that the lack of instruction and transition between moves was frustrating. My biggest complaint, however, was the lack of a decent cool down, especially for the upper body. Of course you can add your own stretches afterward, which is what I did. Stretching after a vigorous workout is very important, and should not be neglected. It was still a decent workout, but def gotta add solid cool down.",Cook With Us 2 Day,2019-01-18T16:08:17Z,0

And they do not cause the rebound weight gain common to all the other rapid weight loss systems that are not backed by the latest science. It takes advantage of a recent scientific discovery that proves the effective weight loss power of an ancient spice. Combined with other cutting edge ingredients you can make right in your own kitchen in minutes — this system is the quickest, easiest and most enjoyable way to quickly get the body you desire and deserve.

"the exercises are good but my problem is that the instructor does not instruct. I like it when they demonstrate before the move, say what is good form what is bad form, how heavy weights they recommend, actually give modifications or alternatives. this is only a problem because she gives no time between the moves for me to accommodate, I had to constantly pause the video and start again. Could be an amazing video and will probably use it in the future again, but I felt like I was just watching a woman work out, not actually being led by an instructor",Tímea Time,2019-01-14T19:14:36Z,164

"I disagree. Most workout videos are catered toward the beginner, which is great, but once you move beyond beginner, you find you don’t need or want as much instruction. There are very few videos out there for those who know the moves. It was very refreshing to finally find a video that moved quickly from move to move. I wish there were more videos like this. I loved the intensity too!",UpNorth Life,2019-10-14T03:18:10Z,19
"I loved the combo moves but because they are combo moves they need to be numbered probably rather than timed so that we can perform and finish the sequence more effectively. That, combined with the lack of instruction, might have contributed to Allie&#39;s very poor form, especially through those push-ups sequences.",Sonia Myre,2019-05-30T11:27:19Z,1
