I think all of the stuff you’ve shown in your wedding series really highlights the real happiness and love and community that weddings are supposed to be about instead of all the etiquette and money worries that you’d see online. It’s really beautiful and heartwarming to see the good side of something that can cause lots of stress and tension for people. I literally cry during every one of these because you can really see how much you guys and your friends and family really care about each other🤧,Potatoes N’ Molasses,2019-06-30T22:25:44Z,547

"Anna Simonsen a bachelorette party is to celebrate the end of her &quot;single&quot; life and the start of her marriage. the girls essentially party. and it&#39;s usually held at night, depending on the bride. the bridal shower is held during the day and it&#39;s like a baby shower. friends and family gift them things they might need for their first home together. blenders, toasters, microwaves, basically home appliances. but because tess and pat have been sharing a home for quite some time now, the bridal shower seemed like more of a formality and like she said, an excuse to be around friends and family. again, it depends on the bride/couple&#39;s situation. but yeah, that&#39;s basically the difference.",m.,2019-07-01T00:01:37Z,99
