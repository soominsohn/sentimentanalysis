"God&#39;s design for us is to be in perfect relationship with Him. His plan is one of freedom, meaning and purpose. He created us, loves us and wants the best for us.<br /><br />Yet, in pursuit of our own meaning, we decided to live our own way, ignoring God and His plan. Our selfish ways (sin) separate us from relationship with God, leaving us broken and empty.<br /><br />Out of love, and knowing we couldn&#39;t fix our brokenness, God sent His Son, Jesus, to earth as the solution. Jesus lived a perfect life, yet chose to die to pay the penalty for our selfish ways. He then rose back to life, defeating death.<br /><br />Because Jesus died, we are no longer separated from God. We have a way back into relationship with Him. Jesus is the way to true freedom, meaning and purpose. By defeating death, we know He is God&#39;s Son.<br /><br />To live in this freedom we must admit our brokenness, ask for forgiveness, and choose to let Jesus lead our lives. Only then can we live fulfilled and happy lives. Jesus changes everything. Forever.",ZYT___,2021-05-04T20:19:24Z,0

"The explanation is uncanny. But mirrors are a lot like black holes as well, and white holes of course. One takes the image in forever just about it seems, the other spits out the image a tiny bit later, and like unto a white hole on the other side we see we can&#39;t send any more through. The image and light of it are processed, and put out as is, meaning an actual mirror image would have to be from the outside of the object entirely. Imagine living backwards... <br /><br />If you&#39;re living backwards, wouldn&#39;t light be darkness and vice versa? Also time might just be backwards too, maybe you&#39;d be walking backwards, and letting food back onto your plate... A backwards world like unto a mirror world, where your life is running backwards, but there are others whose lives are indeed forward to them... Now reimagine what a black hole is capable of, with a white hole on the other end, and remember what I explained about mirrors; <br /><br />The image getting trapped in the glass. And the image that can only be seen on the other side of the mirror itself. <br /><br />You actually see another version of yourself, but from another past.<br /><br />When someone interferes with you in there, run.",Calem Linke,2021-04-23T20:22:03Z,0

But our brain eventually turns the image the right way to what we see now.<br />And why did I type all of this from I learned long ago in what middle school or elementary?

"He&#39;s basically saying that the direction in which you present symbols, specifically letters, to a mirror, dictate the way they appear in a mirror. He does so in a way that stretches your attention in multiple directions, forcing you to focus or watch a few times over. Go try it for yourself with a sharpie and a piece of paper.

"I believe when people say &quot;things get flipped in the mirror&quot; they are reffering to the fact that when you raise up your right hand in front of the mirror, your reflection raises up his left hand. Instead of asking if its flipping or not answer me this, what is a reflection, does a mirror reflect depth or does it reflect a very detailed 2D image?

"What is the purpose of our existence? Is it simply to have a good job, build a family, and enjoy life? Is that all there is? Certainly not. We’re made for so much more. Your purpose is to know God. After we die, the Bible says we’ll face God as our Judge. Have you ever rebelled (sinned) against God? Examine yourself by God’s Law, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever told a lie? Ever stolen (the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” In God’s courtroom, our sins are very serious crimes. They’re so evil that the just punishment is death and eternity in a terrible place called Hell.<br /><br />The Bible says that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He is rich in mercy and provided a Savior: “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Jesus Christ died on the cross, paying the death penalty for sinners. He then rose from the dead three days later, defeating death. Hundreds saw Him after His resurrection; it’s no fairy tale. Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies about the promised Savior, written in the Holy Scriptures hundreds of years before His birth.<br /><br />Religious rites, sacred traditions, or attending church can’t save you. Salvation is a free gift of God that you can’t earn. To know God and have your sins forgiven, do what the Bible says: repent and believe. Trust in Jesus as you’d trust in a parachute—don’t just “believe” it can save you, put it on and cling to it with all of your being. Wholeheartedly commit yourself to following Christ, and turn your back on sin. Then show your gratitude by obeying His command to be baptized. Be sure to also join a Christian church and read the Bible daily. God will never let you down.",Marko,2021-04-08T18:05:17Z,0

What’s really interesting is that CHOICE looks like the same word when flipped around is because all the letters split in half are equal. For example split CHOICE<br />In half horizontally and the half is the quotient to the half.<br />This is easy to figure out as Vsauce doesn’t change the angle but flips it.<br />He uses word play to mess with your head that’s why it’s so intriguing! <br /><br />FYI I’m in 7th grade :D <br />This is for those who don’t know how Vsauce did it.<br />He uses the fact of orange can be flipped as a distraction to play with your head from the real trick!,DankFam Lit,2021-04-06T09:52:44Z,0

"Due to a brain injury as a child, I suck at mirrors. I can read words that are flipped as though they are normal. The downside is that I don&#39;t recognize my own reflection. <br />If I&#39;m standing in front of a mirror I am aware that I am looking at myself. However, when I am unaware of a reflective surface I will be startled by this stranger looking back at me.<br />If I walk by a window with friends, I will often look around for the stranger that has infiltrated our ranks. It takes me 2-10 seconds before I realize that it was me.",Lawn Bear,2021-04-05T23:16:01Z,0

"Hense the term &quot;mirrored image&quot; because the image isnt reversed, that would be a reversed image. A mirrored image appears reversed when it seen because you are showing it to the mirror reversed. Mirror image is used a lot when in actuality reversed image should be used....now you will always be a word police member because you wont be able to stop yourself from telling people this o  the rare occasion you hear it....HAHAHAHA I took that from you.",Leviathan,2021-04-05T14:28:57Z,0

"If traumatization and violence can affect and rewire an individuals brain, I wonder what effect it has to experiment on human beings as test subjects. For instance, I woul draw comparisons to Nazi scientists during the holocaust in order to see what type of changes occur in the personalities and thinking of both the ones experimented on and those doing the experiments. I have a hunch that it may have negative behavioral side effect of both, while the only the one that funds the research wins the most, in terms of new technology that may be weaponized to control or brainwash more of the population.",J.

"Most newbies fail simply because they don&#39;t understand how the market works in general or in particular how the market relates to stock/forex or currency pair they entering. If a retail trades doesn&#39;t grasp what the market makers are doing and when they are doing it, the greatest strategy in the world will fall. For new traders the markets are like entering an F1 race before you&#39;ve passed your drivers license test. One more advantage is the possibility to benefit from repetition. Without this type of strategy, you probably won&#39;t know what worked or why it worked and even if you did, it would be hard to repeat therefore for you need a perfect mentor to teach you perfectly to enable you invest and trade accurately on your own, which i highly recommend you Mr Hercules He guides me with the exact time frame to trade and now I just received my first withdrawals of $30k in my bank account today I&#39;m very happy, my advice is for you to contact him he will guide you perfectly well, and thank me later, I guess this is a good way to show my heartfelt appreciation for literally breaking the chain of my financial debit when I needed it most, you can contact him on his email 📧 <br /><br />(elvishercules48@gmail.com)",Walker Gigs,2021-03-31T01:16:03Z,0

Started wearing my hair the other way because I realized the reason I looked weird in photos was because thats how I actually look and the mirror me is the me I&#39;ve become accustomed to. BUT now if I flip my hair the other way. Everyone ELSE sees me how I see MYSELF on a camera and so id look odd to THEM.

It&#39;s lonely at the top; but you do eat better.<br />8. Honk if you like peace and quiet.<br />9. Always go to other people&#39;s funerals, or they won&#39;t go to yours. <br />10. It&#39;s been Monday all week.<br /><br />Editorial:<br /> Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is &quot;Eat right. Stay fit. <br />Die anyway.&quot; It&#39;s sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. <br />This is because you have sinned against God. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s true: <br />Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, <br />&quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery <br />already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with lust? If you have said <br />&quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, <br />thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only looked at three of the Ten <br />Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or <br />guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not<br /> God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son <br />to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, <br />while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the<br /> dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who<br /> confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do <br />that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a <br />wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God<br /> will never let you down.",egymario,2021-03-28T14:04:08Z,0

"Take a video about this , at least something in your life will do<br />global satanic elite it consists of around 10,000 people , from well-known Merkel , Sarkozy, bill gates , Zuckerberg , Sergey Bryl and Larry page , the Bush family, the Clintons , Rockefellers , Rothschild, Baruch,Leiba, Morgan, Carnegie , almost all Royal and Imperial families from around the world and many other names .They are behind the world wars, they created and spread the coronavirus, the main goal is to ensure the arrival of the Antichrist and prevent the second coming of Jesus and the last judgment , such conditions are allowed by God, because before destroying Lucifer (iblis),because he disobeyed God and did not worship Adam , he asked not to kill him, to leave him alive, and for this he will experience the creation of God - man in particular and humanity in general, Lucifer(iblis) . For mankind there are 3 options for the outcome of the first coming of Antichrist and the fall spirit that it has not been rewarded with the 2nd coming of Jesus and then judgment will not, and will all be erased in the dust , except for the approximate 190.000 people who helped the devil to defeat the mankind and the Second variant of the Human spirit on a global scale will be such strong that will not work with them to bring the Antichrist , and will have 2 coming of Jesus and then there will be judgment . Well, the last option they will achieve the coming of the Antichrist , but humanity in general will fight for itself and God will let down Jesus and we will win and there will be a last judgment .They are fighting for eternal life for themselves, and for us they want to leave the option that we will all be wiped out and not even bother with the last judgment . The outcome depends on each of you , and your life after death .This is the information you need to know why Satanic is actually doing all this .And our task is to stop them .

"So, technically, mirrors flip things in-out -- there&#39;s no left-right flipping, you&#39;re right, you&#39;re the one doing that, but the in-out flip is a real thing, it&#39;s just harder to describe. It&#39;s maybe easier to explain when you compare this to seeing a mountain reflected in a lake, which appears upside-down. It&#39;s because the mountain goes up, away from the surface of the lake.",Josh Hickman,2021-03-27T02:43:43Z,0

"You may be thinking of Einstein&#39;s use of the phrase &quot;For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.&quot; What he means is that all of space time - from the big bang to however things &quot;end&quot; - exists fully and completely all at once. Things don&#39;t &quot;come into being&quot; in the future or recede into the past - that&#39;s just an illusion. All of it exists right now, has since the beginning of space time, and never goes away. We just &quot;travel&quot; through it, and it is only our experience that makes it seem as if there&#39;s a difference between past and future, and hence an experience of &quot;time.&quot;<br />Think of the entirety of spacetime as being a giant loaf of bread - at one crust slice is the start of spacetime, and the other crust slice is the end of spacetime. But the entire loaf exists all at once and came out of the oven fully baked - it&#39;s not changing at all. Imagine a tiny ant starting at the beginning crust and eating it&#39;s way through in a straight line from one end to the other. It can&#39;t back up and it can&#39;t change it&#39;s pace. It can only move steadily forward and with each bite it can only get sensory input from the part of the loaf it&#39;s sensory organs are touching. To the ant, it seems that each moment is unique, and while it may remember the moments from behind it, it hasn&#39;t yet experienced the moments to come. It seems there&#39;s a difference in the past and future, but the loaf is already there on both ends. Now what makes it weirder is that the ant itself is baked into the loaf from start to finish so in a sense it&#39;s merely &quot;occupying&quot; a new version of itself from one moment to the next. This also isn&#39;t quite right, since it&#39;s more accurate to say that the ant is a collection of all the separate moments the ant experiences. It&#39;s not an individual creature making it&#39;s way from one end to the other - it&#39;s the entire &quot;history&quot; of the creature from start to finish.<br />Conceptually difficult to grasp with our limited minds, and this has serious repercussions for the concept of free will, but those are different subjects for different discussions.",Eetu Rautavirta,2021-03-26T22:36:35Z,0

"@Pai Mei I take out a 100k loan to buy a house, do I have to pay it back (plus interest)? YES I take out a 20k loan to buy a car, do I have to pay it back? YES. These people took out loans to pay for college, they took the money, spent the money, they got the degree they wanted, and now they do not want to have to pay the money back. THEY CHOSE to borrow the money, NOT ME, They chose to become a Teacher, or Art Major, or Business Major, NOT ME. Why do I have to pay for other people to &quot;Follow their Dreams&quot;? My Dream is to own my own private Island,,,, Who is going to pay for me to follow my Dream? they took out the money, spent it, and knew they would have to pay it back, NOW they are saying &quot;I do not want to have to pay it back&quot; TOO FUCKING BAD. Who payed for your house? Who payed for your car, Who pays for your clothing/TV/computer. Taking out a loan whether it is for a car/house/college is a promise to borrow money and then pay it back. Taking money with the promise of paying it back and then not paying it back is stealing. SO please tell me, how someone taking out 60k in loans and then not paying it back is not stealing? If you loaned me 60k on the promise that I would pay you back and then I did not pay you back, would you be OK with that?<br />They knew what they were doing, but now are saying? UH I did not know what I was doing, so I should not have to pay back the 60k I borrowed and spent. That would be a slap in the face to every hard working American citizen who went to college and ACTUALLY payed back the money they borrowed. Those who are not paying it back are basically trying to steal the 30-60-100k they borrowed.",tbirum,2021-03-28T04:33:17Z,0
"@tbirum From the debt apart, there are I think only 5 countries in the world that are not in debt but the US is financially bad not only since today, it drags on for decades and it is getting worse rather than better.  In my opinion, the US needs a new electoral system first, this corrupt 2 party system only works for rich people. I don&#39;t believe that people like Trump or Biden are running the country but lobbyists and big corporations who also finance the elections. The 2020 election campaign alone cost over $6 billion, or maybe if you put a little less than $700 billion a year into the military, you could at least try to start a new direction with that money, but the rich people probably don&#39;t want that.<br />Something fundamental would have to change before a social system like many countries in Europe have would make sense in the US. I agree with you on that point but in principle minimum wages, free health care, free college tuition, student loan forgiveness, etc are a good thing even if you have to pay a lot more taxes as a citizen.",Pai Mei,2021-03-28T04:02:57Z,0
"@Pai Mei I understand what you are saying and I do agree with a lot of what you are saying, BUT The United States has 330 Million people , how many does your country have? The United States is 25+ Trillion dollars in Dept around 9 trillion of that is foreign dept, How much is your country in dept? Yes it is too late for the United States to &quot;Embrace Socialism&quot; and that is what those who are pushing for it do not seem to understand, Even with 330 Million people IF we had no Dept or very little then we could have free/nearly free Health care and Very low cost College tuition etc etc etc. But we ARE 25+ Trillion in Dept. We can not just say. Well &quot;Lets pretend that we do not have 25+ trillion in dept and give everyone free college - free health care and 15+ dollars an hr (our national Average is 8.25 US so they basically want to increase that by 80%) The money has to come from somewhere,,,,So where does it all come from? If you want to do a fun experiment Pretend that you make 1 dollar every second that would be 3600 dollars per hr and you got that every hour there are 24 hrs in a day and 365 days in a year so that would be 3600 X 24 X 365  (That would be 31,536,000) dollars per year) Now that would be pretty awesome to make that much money per year, right? Who wouldn&#39;t love to have that kind of salary. NOW divide 1 trillion by 31,536,000 to find out how long it would take you to become a Trillionaire.  Did you come up with nearly 32,000 years? NOW Multiply that by 25, That is how far the United States is in Dept.",tbirum,2021-03-28T02:46:16Z,0
"@tbirum I understand some of the points you make here, but I wasn&#39;t talking about changing everything overnight. I come from Europe where we have a social system that allows us to do just that. Sure we have to pay a lot more taxes but I think it far outweighs the benefits we get. Schooling and college are almost free and make it easier to start a career while many in the US are already in debt before they start working.<br />Also you never know when fate will strike you even if you eat healthy and take care of your body I got sick at the age of 35 and was in the hospital for 2 months with multiple surgeries it took me 2 years to get back in shape and I had to pay almost nothing out of my own pocket because everything was covered by health insurance whereas in the US I probably would have had to sell everything I owned to pay the bills. <br />The minimum wage in my country is 9.35 € or 11.03 $ with which one wants to ensure that people can rent a small apartment and also have enough to eat and drink and not become homeless as in the U.S. or have to sleep in their cars. You have to offer people perspectives and motivate them. Even for the people who can&#39;t find a job here, social help is provided. if you are homeless and no one helps you and you are left alone with your problems, the path to alcohol and drugs is not far, which then leads to crime. <br />But I just realized while writing here that maybe it is already too late for the US or simply not feasible. If your government or people like you are not willing to help other people that they can also become a valuable member of society.",Pai Mei,2021-03-27T21:54:18Z,0
"@tbirum The sky is blue because your brain says it&#39;s blue, you idiot. Blue is an actual color in the EM spectrum, if you didn&#39;t know.

"This video brings some anger back to the boil from when one of my physics teachers adamantly declared that mirrors flip things horizontally and not vertically. When questioned why, she said “man will never know”. Great teaching... it’s sad that this is probably one of the only things I remember from her classes. <br /><br />It’s so obvious. This video explains it perfectly.<br /><br />You could go one step further and push pins through the outline of the shape at regular intervals then hold it right up against the mirror to show that the pins touch the mirror and go straight back to the shape without any magical crossover, illustrating that the light beams behave in the same manner.",ShALLaX,2021-03-26T21:18:46Z,1

"😂😂😂😂😂😂<br />Can&#39;t stop laughing Today I was coming back from church, in the bus there sat a very pretty girl. All the guys in the bus were staring at her. Many of them passed their destination without knowing, I sat next to her,actually. I did all the signs I could to make her feel my presence but all in vain. An idea came to my mind. I took my phone and faked a call: Me: Hello Mum,u see what i&#39;m saying? I&#39;m sick of British Airways! I told u this before! They&#39;ve just cancelled my flight to the US. This is why i prefer Royal Dutch Airlines. Above all,could u believe i&#39;m in a public vehicle? On my way back from the Airline office,my 2016 Leather Roofer Wrangler got bad. Before i left home,Dad planned using the Bentley Continental,and i guess also that u would&#39;ve been out with ur 2016 Mercedes Benz GLE 450. Pls ask the driver to rush down here with the 2017 Cabriol Range Evogue and pick me up. Don&#39;t worry, mum...,OK...,i will...,i will...,thank u,mum...! Love u too,mum...,bye! All this while the girl was looking at me, I said in my heart that she will fall for me if I talk to her ... Me: Hi baby, y r u looking at me like that? R u surprise? Girl: Pls collect ur phone battery. it fell down when u were removing it from your pocket.  😱OMG ! I didn&#39;t know what to do anymore.<br />😂😂😂😂 <br />Thanks so much for reading my joke, <br />If you enjoyed it, Please can you do me  a favour,  I want you to please SUBSCRIBE to my channel,    I know u are capable. 💛💛👍 it very simple <br />Just touch my profile picture and  you  will see where to SUBSCRIBE  Plsssssssssss🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",Mr & Mrs Hilarious,2021-03-26T21:09:00Z,1
