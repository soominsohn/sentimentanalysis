@NebbyWebby it comes from athletes winning gold from Olympics or any international sport events. People gather up at the &quot;market place&quot; (I don&#39;t live in Helsinki I don&#39;t remember the name of the place) and have a victory celebration there with the athletes. They show it live on tv at least if it&#39;s ice hockey world championship gold. There&#39;s popular music artist and hosts and stuff... 🥇,Ragdoll,2021-04-28T01:39:51Z,4

"To everybody saying why Finns haven&#39;t pointed this out to him already: because to our ears, they don&#39;t really sound the same. The stress is on a different syllable, and there&#39;s a diphthong in the last vowel in &#39;viisaus&#39;, whereas in Vsauce, there&#39;s just a long vowel (and a different vowel from either of those making up the diphthong). If Vsauce was written according to Finnish orthography, it&#39;d be something like &#39;vii soos&#39; (two words since one way for Finns to separate one word from the previous one is to listen to where the main stress falls; it&#39;s always on the first syllable of the word, except in words that have no stress at all).",Janne Peltonen,2021-04-08T14:01:49Z,0

"Fun fact: <i>viisaus</i> comes from the word viisas, meaning &quot;wise&quot; + <i>-us</i> (quality suffix, i.e. English -dom, -ness, or -ity). This comes from Proto-Finnic *viisas, with the same meaning, in turn borrowed from Proto-Germanic *wīsaz, &quot;wise&quot;, probably around 500 CE. This is also the origin of the English word &quot;wise&quot;, making English <i>wise</i> and Finnish <i>viisas</i> cognates, words that have a common origin.",MC King,2021-04-08T12:42:41Z,0

"I&#39;ve been to Finland before, but just in the airport changing flights. I am a typical white European guy. There was a woman checking tickets, and saying &quot;huomenta&quot; to everyone who approached her. And I noticed she said &quot;good morning&quot; to a chinese looking guy. I was thinking well I&#39;m a white guy so she&#39;s gonna say huomenta when she gets to me. Anyway when she got to me she said &quot;good morning&quot; and I was like whaaat how do you know I&#39;m not finnish and she just laughed and moved onto the next person!

"There are PLENTY of genetic markers and physical-aesthetic features like face shape, clothing choice, etc. that really, subconsciously, help people differentiate between peoples. Take the &quot;standard&quot; white European: side by side, with enough background analysis, someone who&#39;s genetic background is primarily from Germany will have different facial features from someone born in Sweden - even if they have identical hair/eye color.",Will Murphy,2021-04-10T04:43:56Z,1
I don&#39;t think this is a super power at all. Sometimes you can tell who&#39;s a foreigner by their behavior and in some cases by their clothing choice.

"Thought it sounded weirdly close to the Indo-European root, considering it&#39;s not an Indo-European language. Looked it up, and apparently, the Finnic root is a borrowing from Proto-Germanic *wīsaz (&quot;wise&quot;). So the word &quot;viisaus&quot; has basically the same origin as the English word &quot;wisdom&quot;, and same goes for &quot;viisas&quot; and &quot;wise&quot;. <br /><br />But also, it has the same origin as all the other words in Indo-European languages which come from the Indo-European root (which was related to both knowing and seeing) from which this Germanic root comes. <br /><br />This includes &quot;wit&quot;, of course, but also the Latin root related to seeing, so : in English, the words &quot;visible&quot;, &quot;vision&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, and many other words, the Romance words for &quot;to see&quot; : Italian &quot;vedere&quot;, Spanish and Portuguese &quot;ver&quot;, French &quot;voir&quot; (past participle -&gt; vu, from which the noun &quot;vue&quot;, from which English &quot;view&quot;), Romanian &quot;vedea&quot;, etc.<br /><br />It also includes Ancient Greek ἰδέᾱ, which &quot;idea&quot; comes from (the v/w element was dropped in this one), but also, interestingly enough, ῐ̔στορῐ́ᾱ (historíā, &quot;history&quot;), though it&#39;s harder to see (hehe get it?). <br /><br />There&#39;s also Sanskrit वेद (véda, &quot;knowledge&quot;, from which we derived &quot;Vedic&quot;), along with other Sanskrit words from the same root. <br /><br />We get the Slavic root related to seeing as well, for example in the word for &quot;to see&quot; : Russian ви́деть (vídet&#39;), Bulgarian ви́дя (vídja), Polish &quot;widzieć&quot;, and so on.<br /><br />That&#39;s just a sneak peak, there are many, many words I didn&#39;t mention, including in some Indo-European languages I didn&#39;t mention, like Albanian or Armenian, or any of the Celtic, Baltic, or Iranian languages...

"Although it is an interesting coincidence, there&#39;s still much that differentiates the two. Vsauce is something along the lines of /viːˈsɔːs/ or /viːˈsɔs/ while viisaus is [ˈʋiːsɑu̯s]. They have different word stress, initial consonants and the last syllable has a diphthong in the Finnish word while the English one simply has a long/short vowel sound. This certainly displays the differences between the two languages.",michCOdel,2021-04-07T10:31:36Z,2
"Your phonemic transcription of Vsauce is dubious. It&#39;s /ˈvisɑs/ or /ˈvisɔs/ (doesn&#39;t matter which because Michael&#39;s accent is fully cot-caught merged), not /viːˈsɔːs/. First, vowel length isn&#39;t written in broad transcription for General American English because it isn&#39;t phonemically distinctive, and neither is it for Michaels specific accent. Second, the stress is pretty clearly on the first syllable. It&#39;s VEEsauce not viSAUCE. Also, you should probably compare them both in the same type of transcription, not like it is now with one in broad and the other in narrow.",Spinnis,2021-04-09T01:13:54Z,1

"The Spotsylvania County of Virginia passed a resolution on March 23, 2021, condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s persecution of Falun Gong as well as the brutal crime of harvesting organs from living practitioners.<br /><br />Since last year, seven other counties in the state have passed similar resolutions to condemn the CCP’s human rights abuses, including Fairfax County, Shenandoah County, Frederick County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, Fauquier County and Warren County.<br /><br /><br />Board of Supervisors’ Meeting in Spotsylvania County on March 23, 2021<br /><br />Ms. Wang Chunyan, a Falun Gong practitioner and survivor of torture in China, testified at the Board of Supervisors’ meeting. Ms. Wang said, “I am very honored to stand here today. It also makes me emotional. I was almost killed and could have been made a victim of the organ harvesting crime in China for practicing Falun Gong.”<br /><br />Ms. Wang was an entrepreneur in Dalian City, Liaoning Province. She was once imprisoned for seven years for upholding her faith and suffered all kinds of brutal torture. When she was forced to live away from home to hide from the police, the police beat her husband to death. Her two sisters were also arrested for talking to people about Falun Gong.<br /><br />Kevin Marshall, Chairman of Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors, said, “We don’t want anything like this to go unnoticed.” He said he hopes every resident in the county will be aware of the crime and no one will participate in it.<br /><br /><br />Kevin Marshall, Chairman of the Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors<br /><br />Gary F. Skinner, another member of the Broad of Supervisors, commented, “Let’s stand up and be strong and say ‘stop it.’”",Hui Li,2021-04-07T00:45:53Z,0

"We are all sinners and we cannot save ourselves! If a person gets to heaven because they kept the commandments or stopped sinning, then that would mean that they were saved by their works. But we are not saved by our works! We are saved by grace through faith! Salvation is a completely free gift! Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, was buried in a tomb and rose again on the third day. If a person continues to be disobedient, they are still saved because Jesus Christ paid the price for their sins. All of their sins! Past, present and future. Once a person believes the gospel, they are sealed until the day of redemption and they cannot lose their salvation. No matter what!",Miguel D,2021-04-06T23:33:03Z,1

"10 of the World&#39;s Funniest One Liners<br /><br />1. Work is for people who don&#39;t know how to fish.<br />2. If you don&#39;t like the news, go out and make some.<br />3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else.<br />4. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of &quot;Smart&quot;?<br />5. He who laughs last thinks slowest.<br />6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools.<br />7. Laugh alone and the world thinks you&#39;re an idiot.<br />8. National Atheist&#39;s Day April 1st.<br />9. All generalizations are false.<br />10. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.<br /><br /> Editorial:   Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is &quot;Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway.&quot; It&#39;s sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, &quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with lust? If you have said &quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.",egymario,2021-04-06T19:10:54Z,0

"If Wiktionary is correct, the words &quot;wise&quot; and &quot;viisas&quot; are cognate (the word viisaus comes from &quot;viisas&quot; meaning wise, with the suffix -us making it an adjective). They both come from the Proto-Germanic &quot;wīsaz&quot;. English got it with the Anglo-Saxons in Old English, and separately maybe Proto-Finnic borrowed it at some point because it&#39;s found in all the Baltic-Finnic languages, like Estonian or Ingrian too.",Olli Wilkman,2021-04-06T08:54:59Z,0

"the other uralic languages do not share this... and now i&#39;m down a rabbit&#39;s hole of etymology<br /><br />weirdly, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish both use visdom, but Icelandic doesn&#39;t, even though they are all Upper Germanic languages, so the concept, or at least word for, ~&#39;the state of being wise&#39; wasn&#39;t brought about until after Iceland was settled/established... potentially.<br /><br />wis - dom<br /><br />google only gives etymology of the word to middle english, nothing before<br /><br />i feel like &#39;wis&#39; probably comes from a common root of the German word &#39;wisse&#39;, meaning &#39;know&#39;.<br /><br />&#39;dom&#39;... ?... domain is the same word in English and German, and -dom as a suffix in English is reference to a domain, which originally just meant kingdom/land/etc., but I imagine the original word for domain became somewhat allusory* over time.<br /><br />*allusory doesn&#39;t seemed to be recognized as a word outside of Wiktionary, but it seems to me to make fair enough sense, especially when considering the word illusory exists.<br /><br />i could have gone with allusive, perhaps, but that makes me think of the word elusive.<br /><br />...oddly, the etymology for elusive goes back to latin &#39;eludere&#39;, and the etymology for illusion goes back to latin &#39;illudere&#39;, which... i mean they must have come from the same word as some point... no?<br /><br />aaaand, the etymology for allusion goes back to late latin &#39;alludere&#39;... so there&#39;s that<br /><br />&#39;eludere&#39; - latin, elusive<br />&#39;illudere&#39; - latin, to mock which eventually became to deceive, although I suspect along the lines of trick<br />&#39;alludere&#39; - late latin, from latin &#39;ad ludere&#39; literally meaning &#39;to play towards&#39;<br /><br />while eludere and illudere may share a root, alludere certainly doesn&#39;t, as elusive and illusion could seemingly relate, allusion wouldn&#39;t.<br /><br />thanks for the adventure, brain... friggin jerk.",ReadSetData,2021-04-06T00:37:10Z,1

"You&#39;re a math guy, I like math. Yes this is unlikely, but is it. Think about how many words you could use to help describe this channel. Wisdom, Science, intelligence, enlightenment, how ever you want to stretch it agree or disagree with ones I said. Now each one of those could be a translated word sounding like Vsauce. Now imagine all the languages, every single language is an Opertunity for 1 of their words to sound like Vsauce, all the word needs to do now is be a description of the channel. But that&#39;s just it, this is 1 channel. There are thousands of channels and this is the only one I&#39;ve seen have this. ANY channel can make this video on the coincidence of their name choice, but only 1 needs to be right. <br /><br />To me this is not as improbable as you might think at first.
