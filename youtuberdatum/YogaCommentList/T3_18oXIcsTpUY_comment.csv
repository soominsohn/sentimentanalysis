"This session continues to help us learn about the philosophy of yoga too.  <br /><br />For example, snuggling up to the role of the observer has changed my whole life. <br /><br />Off the mat, this practice has allowed me to pause more, and notice my reaction before  I make a choice on how I want to consciously react to that emotional response. This has helped me to be a better listener, to move with more mindfulness, and to act with greater intention and purpose.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-09T14:18:54Z,1015
Thank you Adriene.  I have been pretty stressed these last few days.,Fer-De-Lance,2021-04-14T16:08:39Z,0
"Awwww, being my own, best, observer of my thoughts and emotions and being aware of them and choosing to react, respond, or just think &quot;How important IS this?&quot;, &quot;Take it easy&quot;, and &quot;Keep an open mind&quot; work well for me. &lt;3 I have a stiff knee with arthritis so the first sit and reach forward asana was relatively impossible, thus I adapted it as best I could. &quot;Happy Baby&quot; was such a treat for me, fully of joy, that it&#39;s never too late to be a Happy Baby. &lt;3 Namaste, Adriene &lt;3",Jan Joyce Lehde,2021-03-25T15:10:31Z,0

Day 8: I started this journey on 21 March. I am inspired by all of you lovely people and I got this idea (on day 4) to leave a comment every day after each session. I rarely finish things like this so if I can do it then you can do it. Look for my comment each day and remember you&#39;re not alone. Breathe.,Stefana Lavinia,2021-03-28T10:49:19Z,2
@Stefana Lavinia Day 8 checking in :) I so agree! This practice is a way to get reconnected with ourselves first and foremost. I held back from doing yoga for years because I didn&#39;t want to be confronted with how &quot;limited&quot; I was in flexibility. I love the kindess of Adrienes voice while I have a little voice in my mind that says &quot;that&#39;s all you can do?&quot; I&#39;m so grateful I decided to do this 30 day series!,crazytlccool,2021-03-31T02:28:05Z,0
"This is exactly what I needed today. At min 6 my hips were really painful, I was nowhere near putting my forearms on the ground. I realise that one of the best things about yoga is learning my body, really knowing how it feels, where there is strength, where I&#39;m limited. I agree with Adrianne that it&#39;s so important to go inwards because I bet most of us are so disconnected from ourselves and our bodies running on autopilot most of the time. I&#39;m so thankful I&#39;m working on this.",Stefana Lavinia,2021-03-28T11:02:08Z,1

"I&#39;ve been returning to day 8 pratices often. To my surprise, i was accompanied tonight with Adrienne&#39;s heart beat - nudging the microphone lightly, like a gentle metronome. I never had noticed it before, until I listened with my headphones tonight. Thank you for that delightful gentle heart thumping that led me to meditate on live force, and how we forget it&#39;s alway there, beating under the protection of our rib cage. I&#39;ve been returning to day 8 practices for the are truly healing for me, and this gift makes them all the more precious.",Marika D'Eschambeault,2021-02-13T02:57:45Z,0

I hadn&#39;t been to the dentist in years, because of extreme fear, and in the afternoon I had to undergo a root canal treatment. I did this session in the morning, making me feel calm and safe, and in the dentist chair I went back in my mind, back to my mat, where it was just me, the earth and my breath. I got through and felt so proud and powerful. Thank you, Adriene. Looking forward to the rest of the 30 days.",FrancienMusic,2021-02-11T19:41:32Z,0

"I just woke up, but I was really doubting whether doing today&#39;s practice. I stayed up super late doing a motivation letter and I am feeling exhausted. Yes, first thing in the morning. Fun. So seeing this practice is called &quot;Snuggle&quot;, I toughend up and went to the mat. So glad I did that. I still feel like I&#39;m too stiff for some the exercises (when Adriene had her legs crossed and went to the forearms I couldn&#39;t even cross my legs properly), but I&#39;m showing up and doing the best I can. With yoga, I&#39;m being able to shut for half an hour my inner critic. It doesn&#39;t seem much, but it&#39;s such a huge accomplishment for me... So yeah.

Love the idea of ‘snuggle’ - it’s been hard to get up n running with the practice this month ... when I was a child I had this cutest pony called ‘Marcus’. He was a light palomino 12.5hands. After morning mucking out in the stable yard Marcus would lay down and I used to snuggle into his side near his head - he was this sweetest of ponies and I fed off this mutual moment of snuggle 🤍✨,Venetia Robinson,2021-01-26T15:32:38Z,0

"I was looking forward to this one, and am not disappointed :). I did struggle with staying focused on the breath, because apparently (when isn&#39;t it), my head was full. I am really hoping that this journey is going to get that tension I feel out of my head. Because of the lockdown, the guy who usually helps me out isn&#39;t allowed to work. It really would be nice anyway to not have to go there anymore though, and instead just pop on the mat every day.",Paula,2021-01-26T08:22:09Z,0

"Day 8 Thoughts:<br>At first I opened the video, but didn&#39;t feel like focusing on something for 30 minutes, so I ended up scrolling through social media for wayyyyyy longer than I should have.  So, this ended up taking much longer.  After I finished,  &quot;I should have just done it earlier.&quot;<br>Idk, today feels a little off somehow.

It really helped on a day that I really needed to sit and comfort myself. I found myself having to pause and allow tears and emotion to flow out at certain moments. It&#39;s interesting how powerful it can be to let go and allow ourselves be vulnerable.

This was EXACTLY what I needed today. Normally I practice mid-morning after getting kids to school, but today was extra challenging so I didn&#39;t get to it until nighttime. Everything about the practice and the timing of it was exactly what I needed, and I feel so grateful! I&#39;m thankful for the opportunity, and to be part of this community. I&#39;m going to keep showing up, even if my pacing looks a little different :).",Wendi Keller,2021-01-12T04:08:34Z,0

"Commenting for accountability Day 8: catching up after getting a bit behind chronologically and am very grateful for this opportunity to rest. Was distracted by some discomfort in my right eye/health fears throughout the practice, felt some tension release in the brow as I relaxed facial muscles at the end, which was nice. Also experienced some fearful anticipation about the upcoming, presumably more energetic practices.",Grackle Mac,2021-01-11T19:21:33Z,0
"So in 2021, I have pledged to do 300 days of yoga as part of my get healthier plan.  This is about my 5th or 6th Adriene 30 day series but it&#39;s been a a year or so since I&#39;ve done any.   I&#39;m not a religious or spiritual person in any way (no 3rd eye for me), meditation makes me anxious and angry and, physically, I could be the worst person at yoga ever (I&#39;m over 50, I&#39;m overweight, my heels have never touched the ground in downward dog, I swear my arms are too short as I can&#39;t even wrap them around my knees when on my back, I have arthritis in both knees and one thumb, and the only &quot;crow&quot; that will ever be in my life is the crow that I eat!) BUT I am so thankful for Adriene and these series as I can do them in the privacy of my own home and she never makes me feel like a yoga loser for what I can&#39;t do.  I&#39;ve learned not to focus on what I can&#39;t do but to modify for what I can and at the end of every session, I find that I have improved, even if in the tiniest bit, in some form - breathing, flexibility, balance - SOMETHING.   By the end of a 30 day session (which honestly may take me 32-35 days) I feel better in my body and mind.  All of this to say, even if you don&#39;t think yoga is for you or that you can&#39;t do it...you CAN.   It may not be perfect, heck it may not even be pretty, but you will thank yourself in the long run.",Mary Blankenship,2021-01-11T19:18:31Z,1
"Thanks, Mary!  I&#39;m 71.  Had done Adriene&#39;s yoga almost every day for 4 years...until I fell off the wagon so to speak over a year ago.  I am SO GLAD to be back.  My body demanded it as my hips got more and more creaky and painful.  I feel improvement all over myself and inside myself already!  Namaste from Lj",Linda Hart,2021-01-11T23:50:29Z,1

"Day 8:<br /><br />It says some things about me that I waded through the first week of practice, in spite of aching muscles and poses I&#39;d never seen before, and kept up every single day, and it&#39;s this kind self-care practice that I put off for an entire day instead.<br /><br />It&#39;s been a long, hard, strange, terrible week, and I am being kind to myself this weekend.  I&#39;m glad to have had this.  I&#39;m glad to have brought myself to do it.  I knew it would be warm and good and feel good to do, and I let it slide away for a day and a half because, well, I didn&#39;t need to push myself and force myself to do something that felt GOOD, did I?  I only got myself to the mat by reminding myself that I wouldn&#39;t feel able to do the hard, important things if I didn&#39;t get through this nice one first.<br /><br />The nice things are important too.  This was worth my time, not just as a necessary unskippable step in the thirty days, but on its own merit.  I&#39;m glad to have done it.<br /><br />Everyone else was on Day 9 today, but I&#39;ll do Day 9 tomorrow, and if I stay a day behind for the rest of the month so be it.  I&#39;m still not alone.  Thousands of people are a day behind, or two days, or three.  Thousands of people will find this sequence in the future, next week or next month or next year, and it will still be worth it.

I have been very worried about the move and about me losing everything and the fear of not making it. Worries that make me doubt my decision. But in that moment, picturing the fresh air and the sun on my skin, in the garden of my new home, I felt content. I felt my heart pulling me deeper into that vision. I have never felt such connection before and it made me tear up in joy and relief. I am on the right path. I know it. I can feel it in my heart right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Such a lovely practice today. And what a difference it makes to be breathing correctly--inhaling down and exhaling up and out. I&#39;ve practiced yoga for years and don&#39;t think I really understood that until this week. I could feel each posture being that much more beneficial just by proper breathing.

"Today&#39;s practice was very hard for me, even though physically it was the easiest one. I didnt feel as if I deserved taking such a long break to just relax. My mind was jumping from one thought to another and I almost quit after fifteen minutes. But I remembered why I started practicing yoga with you years ago. I remembered that this was exactly the place where I needed to be at that moment. So I stayed. And I am incredibly grateful for that. Thank you very much Adriene for everything you offer to so many people in this world. And thank you to everyone else for practicing as well",sonnenessi,2021-01-10T20:00:21Z,69

I cannot form a right angle without bending my legs or rounding my back. I adjusted some of them by sitting on a block, and keeping my legs very bent - but when my lower back started to hurt I came out of the postures and rested. I find it hard because I get so frustrated with myself and my body, but I guess the answer is to accept my body as it is and keep showing up anyway. &lt;3",Sara Evans,2021-01-10T12:25:20Z,0

So thank god today&#39;s practice was low and very relaxing because honestly didn&#39;t feel like moving my body a lot today (already walked so much today lol) So my friends, this shows that life happens FOR you and not TO you.

Some how I have to learn how to not cross the meditation line and nod off.    The good thing is that I catch myself and continue the deep breathing.  Loved the hammie stretchs and the reaching out with the hands.  It is a great stretch for my lower back!  Gracias!,Tony Rodriguez,2021-01-10T02:41:19Z,0

"OMG I loved Barton Springs too!  I&#39;m Australian, but lived in Austin Texas 20 years ago (to study at UT) - and the magnetic pull of Barton Springs for meditative laps as the reeds and small fish of the river beneath played beneath your eyes was just magical.  Such a special place - and a beautiful reminder as we snuggled into Day 8 meditate :) thank you xo",Tanya Spisbah,2021-01-10T02:34:06Z,0

"Maybe my favorite YWA moment ever was my toddler Phoebe doing happy baby with me, smiling, and inspecting the bottom of her socks. Most days it’s hard to do yoga with her climbing all over and generally acting like a tiny drunk human. The home yoga environment doesn’t always support the practice as much as I might like, especially as a new mom in a small home. Today, however, was perfect.",Britt B,2021-01-10T02:15:27Z,0

"I got so upset and frustrated in the first half of this practice, because I don&#39;t seem to get better at forward folds and also can&#39;t for the life of me bring my feet to the center and get down on my forearms...it is impossible. I managed to relax as soon as we moved on to the back though. Anyone else struggling with this? I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s my hips or my legs that prevent me from being able to do forward folds, even though I have been doing yoga for a while now and I&#39;m getting more flexible - in this area things just don&#39;t seem to change :/",moonstruckfaye,2021-01-10T02:01:05Z,0

"I did today&#39;s practice in the corridor as we&#39;re in lockdown and don&#39;t have much space, with my housemates all around me making lots of noise on video calls and walking through the flat. It was definitely a disruptive environment which feels very familiar when my mind gets super busy and it&#39;s hard to ground or focus on my breath. It wasn&#39;t perfect and it was hard to follow the thread throughout but it was pretty useful practice for when things are really hectic and when this kind of practice comes in most useful!",Abigail Whiteley,2021-01-09T21:05:40Z,96

"Thank you for a sweet Day 8 on the mat, Adriene! That idea of “snuggling up to the role of the observer“ is what first grabbed my attention. It made me realize how easy it is to fall into the role of the victim instead...and how disempowering this is. Snuggling up to the role of the observer requires humility and courage. When I do this lovingly, I get to experience a deeper connection to my breath, a detachment from thoughts and emotions, and that “sweet surrender”! Thank you ALL for being a part of my journey! 💞",lynn lederhos,2021-01-09T19:42:10Z,2

I love to see how the energy of these practices is soaked up by my macaws. They come to the bottom of their cage as soon as they see the mat roll out! They watch and walk around the floor of their cage and then coo and preen each other. Today they were snuggling too big time. Great example of how a shift in your own energy extends out to other beings instantly❤Thank you for a loving start to the day. Day 8 in the books!!!,S Sutton,2021-01-09T19:11:11Z,0

"I’m really enjoying this 30 day challenge and I have stuck at it so far. Just one move today was too challenging for me - sitting crossed legs, leaning forward with either elbows or arms/hands on floor out front, fully bent over from the hips. I personally have trouble just crossing my legs. There was no way I could fold over and put my elbows on the floor. I could just about touch the floor with my fingertips. I would have appreciated an alternative. I’ll be back tomorrow though. Little by little. Thanks Adriene.",Sian Griffiths,2021-01-09T18:53:51Z,0

Thankyou so much Adriene :) <br />Second of all, i have a (probably pretty weird) question: My period stopped out of nowhere 6 months ago (I’m 23) and after doing yoga for 6 days, it miraculously came back (so so happy and grateful). Now, my question is, could doing yoga be the reason that my period came back? <br /><br />Side note: I am so proud of everyone who is participating, you ROCK !!",Olivia,2021-01-09T18:46:27Z,1

I&#39;ve been doing Yoga with Adrienne for 6 years. I always do the annual 30 day January practice.  The <br>Breath practice is just what I needed. It is slow and calming with lots of new things to learn.  Breath has always been confusing for me but now I get it. I started late 1/4 but so far everyday is a gem &amp; a welcome respite from our angry world plus it&#39;s kicking my butt.  Thank You Adrienne for a great practice.

Not even close.

Something about the way she phrases the benefits (snuggling up, comforting, deep relaxing) of these poses just triggers me into frustration and anger because I physically can&#39;t do these moves. I have a big belly and body fat and it just seems like she tries to give modifications to these &quot;easier&quot; moves but I can&#39;t even do those. And it always gets really frustrating when we are doing low to the ground poses where we are supposed to fold into ourselves. And it sounds awesome and relieving to get there but I am not able to feel that as well. It&#39;s really hard to accept that and not get frustrated",Nina R.,2021-01-09T18:13:35Z,2

"„Rest your sweet heart“ - thank you so much, dear Adriene! <br>I am so incredibly grateful that I turned to Yoga today. Minutes before pressing play on this video, I got a call that my 95-year-old grandma tested positive for Covid. I was feeling so scared and anxious, even more so because there is nothing I can do at the moment. <br>But then, as soon as I heard your heartbeat, I started to breathe a little deeper, letting go of my worries, piece by piece - breath after breath...<br>I am sending everyone a big virtual hug! 💞",Hanna H,2021-01-09T18:08:59Z,0

"Hi Adriene and all beutiful people in this community, thank you for this practice and your lovely supportive comments. Last few days I&#39;ve felt so bad physically, which is caused by unbearable anxiety. I&#39;m not able to calm my mind down and see anything positively. But at the end of this practice, even though my mind was busy for most of it, I stayed lying a little longer and all the beautiful and happy memories started to show up my in my mind and it was amazing. I know we live in difficult times and everything seems to fall apart, but it&#39;ll pass as long as we&#39;ve got each others backs and as long as we believe in ourselves and that we are strong enough to overcome this. I believe in you! Have a beutiful day :))",Zuzana Gajdošová,2021-01-09T18:04:41Z,0

Was a little nervous about how my body would try to keep up with today&#39;s practice but then I saw it was the Snuggle session and I was so relieved. I&#39;ve done a few of Adriene&#39;s 30 day series now and the one&#39;s with the pillow and blanket props are always a special treat. Snuggle was just what I needed today.

As a person who has loved the practice of yoga for many years, but has been held back from being consistent with it because of not being able to afford the sessions or not having a studio near by - I think making the practice assessible to everyone is something really special!!

"hey heather, spontaneous thoughts on this:<br />If you mean the &quot;lying on the back, foot over knee cross&quot; pose: try to place your ankle on your knee, not just the foot; it should also help to flex the foot; if that  doesn&#39;t help, maybe don&#39;t push your knee away from you, rather pull it in a bit until you don&#39;t feel strain on your ankle anymore. Yoga poses should never hurt, especially not in the joints. <br />If you mean the &quot;cross legged seat, then folding over&quot; pose: my ankles hurt too, maybe because I used a super thin yoga mat. I think some people just have more sensitive ankles...I personally am trying not to go too deep into the pose and I&#39;ll definitely use a thicker mat next time / put some towels/blankets under my normal one :)",Lisa Laquelle,2021-01-09T18:30:10Z,0

"@Shannon Pitts  thank you for this answer, i really appreciate it! sounds like my knee pain (and stress level haha) might be the same as yours, so i’ll keep on the stretching and try to target some thigh and calves muscles! glad to hear that it has helped you:) lots of love.",Carina,2021-01-09T12:58:07Z,0
"When I went to a Dr for knee pain they just gave pain killers, but a friend recommended a physical therapist. When I went, she discovered my pain was actually being caused by tightness in my thigh and calve muscles which was then pulling my knee out of alignment. That&#39;s actually what made me begin doing yoga more regularly (that and my crazy stress LOL). Every person&#39;s body is different, but perhaps your knee pain is also caused by muscle tightness? She had me do stretches and recommended daily stretches/yoga (she said yoga for me to also manage stress because stress can also tighten our muscles) and used KT tape to help stabilize my knee and prevent some muscle tightness. I was honestly a little skeptical at first, but I&#39;m now relatively pain free. Full disclosure, it&#39;s been weeks of stretches and tape...my muscles kept wanting to tighten back up and I had to switch my chair at work). Everyone is different though, hopefully my experience is the same for you and simple stretches/yoga and tape will help, but never ignore chronic pain. Love to you!",Shannon Pitts,2021-01-09T11:50:45Z,1

So happy when i saw &quot;snuggle&quot; as the theme and you were wearing sweatpants <b>let me just skip off real quick for my robe!</b> lol. <br />I didnt know i needed those stretches until today. This felt amazing! Thank you again Adriene for taking your time and doing these videos. Have a great weekend!,Amanda Ritzau,2021-01-09T10:54:15Z,2

"That was the worst for me, the early stretches were so hard for me.  It really made me feel my age and inflexibility.  Unfortunately that stayed with me throughout the rest of the practice.  It will be difficult to get back on the mat tomorrow😕",Richard Whitfield,2021-01-09T10:40:36Z,0
"Come as you are and just do what you can. Our muscles get SO tight and get used to being that way, so it takes time to stretch them back out and keep them that way. Be gentle with yourself. You don&#39;t have to be perfect, just try and do what you can. I hope you don&#39;t give up, but it&#39;s also okay if you decide yoga isn&#39;t for you. Find what feels good and works best for you ❤️",Shannon Pitts,2021-01-09T11:57:23Z,2
Hi Richard. They can be difficult but they do get easier. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself and take rest where you need it and keep showing up for yourself and I can guarantee you will start to look forward to coming to the mat each day 🙂 and if not that&#39;s ok too! Take care!,Natasha Jacques,2021-01-09T10:58:54Z,1

Today, I didn’t realise how small my feet actually were until I started massaging them in cobblers pose 😂 I was always told that my feet were small, but today I was like ‘Woah! They’re actually tiny’. I walked outside and was like ‘Mum look how small they are!’ And she goes ‘took you long enough’ 😂♥️ Mums gotta love ‘em! I hope you all have a great day, evening or night!

"Hi! This practice in particular will be great when you&#39;re on your cycle. In general, listen to your body and find what feels good - if you&#39;re craving some time to rest or a gentle practice, go for it and come back to your regular practice when you&#39;re ready. x",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-09T16:20:54Z,2
