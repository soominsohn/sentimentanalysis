"Yoga offers a sublime opportunity to create an abundance of awareness with your inner world, which will then influence your relationship with the outer world. With each new breath, a new arrival. <br /><br />How are you feeling after today&#39;s session?",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-03T14:34:14Z,2030

@Sarah Rossiter hey I’m a newbie too so I feel you! It’s encouraging to see comments like this to know I’m not the only one who shakes and slips around haha! But like you said focusing on my breathing really gets me through. These videos that Adrienne has done have been life changing. Knowing it’s not so much about the Asanas but more so about the breath has been an game changer for me. Anyway stay strong my friend. We’re all in this together!,Connor Mouser,2021-05-04T02:29:27Z,1
Shaking. Couldn&#39;t do half of it. But I&#39;m gaining strength and awareness. Resting in child&#39;s pose and focusing on breath when it&#39;s too much for me.,Sarah Rossiter,2021-05-03T19:49:44Z,2
"I feel absolutely amazing and “in tune” if that makes sense. I just want to love and be at peace with myself, others, the Earth. I want experience other’s energies and share them. Adrienne, you probably get this a lot, but your Yoga instructions on here have begun to change my life. You are an amazing teacher! When I come to your channel I feel at home. Thank you for all you do!",Connor Mouser,2021-04-30T18:51:56Z,0

Day 2 YEAHH!!!,Mandukhai Batbaatar,2021-04-21T23:00:29Z,0
"I started following one of Adrienne&#39;s 30-day journey in 2019, and that was when I first fell in love with Yoga. That was when I started to learn about the power of breathing! The physical and mental changes that I experienced at the time was so amazing that after completing the 30 day journey, I decided to continue doing Yoga by myself. And for a long time, life was good.<br /><br />I am currently back to who I was before Yoga. Basically stressed, depressed, and constantly tired. I stopped doing Yoga a few months so I didn&#39;t think getting back into will be difficult. But oh boy, I started Day 1 yesterday and oh my god! Poses that used to feel so easy for me somehow became very very difficult. My legs were shaking and when I woke up today, my whole body is sore! I did not want to continue with this. But guess what, I am not gonna give up cause I will reach to that point in life where I can feel good again! <br /><br />I know it&#39;s a long comment but I really needed to do this and since I don&#39;t really have friends that can possibly understand this, I figured the comment sections would have plenty! Stay safe everybody!",Hazi Juzaili,2021-04-20T11:19:26Z,1

"Thinking of each breath as a new arrival really clicked with me. I started to think of the breath entering my body as a friend. When you&#39;re about to meet a friend, you get excited and look forward to it. And when the friend leaves, you tell them how glad you were to see them. So I started to look forward to each breath, and think &quot;Thank you for the opportunity&quot; to say goodbye to each breath as I exhaled and let it go. I&#39;ve never been more able to focus on my breath throughout a practice.<br /><br />I feel very peaceful and grateful for each breath and each opportunity to experience it.",Clarissa Garvey,2021-03-19T21:01:59Z,0

"After having a braintrombose in october (bloodcloth to the brain) and finally feeling up to starting a daily yoga practice again yesterday, I&#39;m wondering if any of you know any herbal teas that don&#39;t contain licorice. I used to drink yogi tea after practice and throughout the day, but my physician told me to avoid licorice at all costs since that increases blood pressure and thus adds to the risk of having another bloodcloth.

"Thank you, Adriene. Today&#39;s practice almost brought me to tears.

Is it okay that I’m really struggling with balance or feeling like I can’t hold positions like enough?,Alanna Byrne,2021-01-30T02:33:52Z,15
"I’m an oldie (64) but used to do yoga in my thirties. I had no problem with balance then but now find it very challenging, perhaps due to my weight gain in the past three decades! The instructor I had before covid suggested a lot of it is in the head. The harder you try, the harder it is. Try to relax and not focus too much on perfection.",artsguru 1,2021-04-25T11:01:41Z,1

Mine did too. But now it&#39;s stronger and hurts less than it used to. Maybe you should try to sit less straight while you&#39;re a beginner. Like Adriene says: find what feels good. But be careful! Maybe you have some problems with your back and should consult you therapist first. Good luck on you journey! 😊😊😊,Nadezhda Chernyavskaya,2021-01-30T15:42:44Z,0

"I found this challenge about mid January and practiced Day 1. And although I really enjoyed and benefitted from Day 1 both mentally and physically, I kept procrastinating practicing Day 2, &#39;cause that&#39;s what I do; procrastinate doing all the good things I want to do. Until today, January 27, when I finally decided to practice Day 2. I&#39;m glad and proud I did this. And I hope I can commit to this challenge. I really appreciate her saying that the hardest part is showing up.<br />And today&#39;s theme/concept was very interesting; to arrive with every new breath, to realize that each breath cycle is a new beginning. I needed that. So, thanks, Adrienne!<br />My point is that if there&#39;s anyone like me in any way, I&#39;m just letting you know that you&#39;re not alone. Keep fighting, for you. 🖤✨",Afnan Waly,2021-01-27T07:30:10Z,0

"its so crazy because a week ago, i looked at the time stamps on these videos and thought, no way could i sit still for this long., but my anxiety worsened over this past month and i know yoga is what makes such a difference. i came down and sat yesterday and today and im literally shocked at how fast time actually goes when you stay present! started late, but glad to be here!",Amy,2021-01-20T02:50:08Z,0

"I like this class a lot. I was there for day 1 too. I just have a critic I hope is useful.<br /><br />The speaking is very monotonous, and it becomes stressful when you have to turn your head up to the screen every five seconds to check if you&#39;re doing it right, or if you have been holding the pose for too long. I have the feeling that I cant trust this voice that goes &quot;so you tuck your chin to your chest and bring your foot onto the mat AND BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR BREATH move this to that and roll up to the sky AND THEN THE IDEA OF THE ARRIVAL...&quot; : I mean, you cant just let the flow go and look for the inflection of the voice to follow the instructions, you have to be there for each word, studying what&#39;s possibly coming at the end of the sentence so you&#39;re not too late doing your move (and if you miss one word - maybe because a car passed or because you&#39;re not fluent in english - then you feel totally lost). And whenever the tone changes, it gets your attention, you get all excited about whats coming next, and you realize it wasnt new information, it was just telling you to relax, which has the opposite effect. ^^",Barkrust k,2021-01-19T10:44:09Z,0

"Day 2 Thoughts:<br />Yesterday, I started doing this.  I had been wanting to, but I kept putting it off because I was making the excuse of &quot;Oh, it&#39;s so long.  I don&#39;t have time&quot; (but I was just sitting on the couch watching YouTube anyways).  However, I realized just how much tension I was holding in my jaw (I have TMJ and it&#39;s been worse lately) and so I sat down and did the video.<br />I woke up today, debating on if I wanted to get out of bed early and do this or if I wanted to sleep an extra hour and just do it in the evening.  I got up and did it.  I&#39;m glad I decided to start my day this way.<br />In order to hold myself accountable, I am going to leave my thoughts in the comments after each day.",mon last name,2021-01-18T22:34:15Z,0

"Decided to try some yoga with this series. It&#39;s kinda hard, especially the whole notion of moving with the breath.

"When you said at the very end that every practice will be different, and you might have a moment where you think you won&#39;t show up, tears came. This practice has definitely got me feeling that way for future practices. It was especially hard, and somehow the &quot;arrive at every breath&quot; that seemed so wonderful in idea was difficult in practice, and made it harder to just breathe. It didn&#39;t help me turn off my thinking brain. I worry that I&#39;m doing too much, and that I&#39;m hurting my body. But I also worry that I&#39;m not doing enough if I modify or just stop doing a certain pose. But every practice will be different. A new beginning. I will try anew tomorrow, even though it is hard, and I will seek to trust myself.",Valaya Hart,2021-01-16T16:26:51Z,3

Got lost momentary during the middle connecting manoeuvres as I struggled with doing and watching at the same time(needed glasses on to see it first!)

"I started this beautiful session on BREATH late too, but as Adriene will tell us, the important thing is, that we are here now. I have been following Adriene for a couple years now; this session has a whole new meaning for me. I have osteoporosis and just got results of my latest bone scan. It is getting worse :(.  I’ve been slacking since the pandemic on self health, exercise, and care, but oh what a blow that result was to my spirit. I’ve jumped back into yoga...and there is no one more humorously, joyfully, spiritually, preciously equipped to join me on my mat, in my prayer room on this new journey than Adriene. I make your yoga tea often too. THANK YOU from the essence of my spirit, mind, and body you gift from our Creator.

“Arrive..show up... and then see what happens. The rest will just unfold.” This really resonated with me today during my practice. I’ve have been feeling a lot of apprehensions about my career and have found it difficult to motivate myself to show up. I have spent the last few weeks overthinking and trying to plan out exactly what my next steps should be. Change is scary. This helped to remind me it’s okay to not know the outcome. Sometimes all you can do is show up and see what happens. Thank you Adriene!,leeshtalks07,2021-01-11T03:19:12Z,136
Absolutely same. I am doing Breath for the second time and have decided to have an exercise book and pen next to me to write a couple things down from each session if I feel like it and I just wrote that down.

"I especially appreciate Adriene&#39;s Rumi poem reference.. So many poignant subtleties in her teachings.. <br /><br />This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes As an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.

"Before coming to my yoga mat for this practice, I had a big big breakdown. I was so upset and depressed with my breakup, my work life and just in myself in general.

"On day 2, today was another hard day. I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t stop comparing me now to me before, when I could do full planks no problem.

"Hey Adriene and friends! I am a beginner at yoga and I&#39;m loving it so far, but I always want to learn how I can better my personal practice. <br />Towards the end of day 2, the pose presented around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaL3YF1vY2k&amp;t=28m00s"">28:00</a> gave a pretty bad strain on my neck as I lifted up. I don&#39;t know if this is from me holding my head a weird way or the general stiffness of my body, but I would love to hear some input on how I can help that abnormal pain in the stretch.<br />I love this journey! Thank you :)",mik,2021-01-08T22:07:07Z,0
"I struggle with neck issues and that pose hurts me every time and I have been doing yoga on and off for 2 years. Some poses just dont feel right for your body so you have to adjust. I found that if I feel a lot of pressure/strain in my neck, i have to listen to my body and just lower my head to the ground. You gotta do what feels good:) Good luck!",Anna Lazarenko,2021-01-09T04:03:05Z,0

"Today was harder, I don&#39;t have a yoga mat and kept sliding around on my blanket during downward dog.   I was almost to tears at one point because I felt so much weaker than I used to, but then I realized I was making it harder than it needed to be.  I YANKED that blanket away and BAM so much easier to just stick to the floor.  Still so hard, don&#39;t get me wrong, but at least I wasn&#39;t working against myself 😊 when I make it through this week, I&#39;m getting myself a real mat 🤩",Abigail Kerr,2021-01-08T15:18:35Z,0

However we are anticipating being well behind as we like to skip the yoga on days that we have another major outing, ie. xc skiing, hiking or even a big birding day.

That&#39;s physically impossible unless you shift your weight to one side, since for instance you only have 1 support on left side (left leg raised) and 2 supports on the right with your center of mass in the middle.

"I&#39;ve never commented before, but I started practicing yoga by following your videos sometime last year. It helped me get through the worst moments of isolation and anxiety. I&#39;m commenting today because this particular practice taught me something so new--the concept of arriving with each inhale. As I&#39;ve continued through the other videos of this series so far, I keep coming back to that. Even when I&#39;m not doing yoga--when I start to get stressed or check out I catch myself inhaling and thinking &quot;arrive&quot; and it&#39;s like... a reset button. I come back to myself. And in practice, I use it to bring myself back when my thoughts wander OR to help when I&#39;m meeting my edge and don&#39;t think I can keep going. &quot;Arriving&quot; on that next inhale when my body is shaking is for me, again, a reset that lets me feel like I&#39;m restarting the session even if I&#39;m in the middle of it. SO yeah. Thank you so much for all your videos, for your kind and fun attitude. &lt;3",Alexis Hunter,2021-01-07T19:05:03Z,0
"I almost didn&#39;t make it to the mat today. I was feeling so down, heavy, drained and I knew if I could make it I would feel better. I had so much on my mind but mid way through practice I forgot about everything because I was so focused on breathing and feeling my stretches. Thank you xoxo",MC Media,2021-01-07T18:59:43Z,0

I am new to the yoga journey I really got into it this year. Even though some days went by without practicing. But I always find myself coming back and trying again.

I need this right now. My housemate is also my best friend - I&#39;ve been in love with him for just under a year and told him about this recently only to be rejected. I can feel a shift happening in our dynamic as we adjust to this information and he allows me the space I need to handle this (we&#39;re in the middle of lockdown so can&#39;t leave the house and I also work with him) but I&#39;m just terrified that this is the beginning of the end of our friendship. I&#39;m a little heartbroken of course but the fear of losing the closeness we have is even worse. Having these practices helps ground me a little and access the emotions I&#39;m struggling with at the moment. Thank you for these videos xx,Emily Clayton,2021-01-06T22:14:51Z,0

These are two of the tightest parts of my body and that position can be very painful at times. But what I’m noticing in this series of videos, as I breath controlled and properly, it has allowed me to take my focus off the feeling and focus more on the stretching.

I&#39;m new to this, and my negative self-talk can start to get in the way (i.e., I&#39;m too old for this, I&#39;m not strong enough, etc.), and it&#39;s encouraging when you validate how something might be aching just as soon as I&#39;m feeling this ache.  I didn&#39;t realize how weak my wrists were until I started this, and the figure eight thing felt so good.

"It was focused on each breath is unique and is an arrival to the moment and is a new beginning. So each breath is important and from the get-go, our yoga is started. It focused on the core, strength on hands, and neck stretch which I rested for all 3 for a few seconds since it got really hard while doing mountain climbing while on the plank and then in stretching the neck while hugging the knee to chest.<br /><br />I felt each breath as an arrival because since the first-ever day of my yoga I think I took it seriously and felt it like this. I am energetic and surprised by how comfortable Adriene was with her core strength moves and how heavily I was breathing instead.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-06T11:02:55Z,0

"These comments are wonderful.  I&#39;ve never really read or contribute to comments much, but they truly are so inspiring.  Everyone has their &quot;stuff,&quot; and we all deal as best we can.  This is my 3rd 30-day challenge , well technically 2nd, b/c in 2020 I got pneumonia the first week of January so it all went out the window.  And today, Jan. 5 (day 4 for those keeping track), I just finished the video above (again, for those keeping track, it is day 2!), so maybe tomorrow I will do days 3,4 AND 5?  Probably not, but that&#39;s OK  I will catch up. Or i won&#39;t, and my Valentine&#39;s Day gift to myself will be one of the final videos, LOL!  Point is, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Just show up.  It really IS the most challenging part.  And I have to add - I am LOVING the room you&#39;re in, Adriene, and the view behind you.  It is both calming and &quot;industrial cool&quot; and really sets the tone.  Kudos to whomever scouted it!  Wishing all good things to all reading this, and those that aren&#39;t.

"oh i just LOOVE these slow practices when i can really focus on my breathing. i&#39;m always lazy to start them but then it just pays off. it adds so much nuance to every movement, really felt it in the neck + wrist stretches, really appreciate those as someone who spends a lot of time on computer. slowing things down also helps me with the strengthening poses too, i think  this was my highest three-legged dog yet lol. although i have to admit that compared to the rest the poses, the runner&#39;s stretch and crescent lunge  felt a tiny bit faster and that i didn&#39;t have time to check my hips and focus on breathing and &quot;un-clenching&quot; the rest of the body. maybe that&#39;s just me though! all in all excellent practice, it really shows that you put a lot of thought into this. thank you &lt;3",Oshanii,2021-01-05T18:36:49Z,0

"I don’t know what I do wrong... Everytime I try for downward dog I just feel pain in the joint connecting my thumb to my palm, and I can’t seem to get a good stretch from it... My hamstrings are also quite tight so I can’t get my heels to the ground. Overall, it’s painful and frustrating because it transitions into other moves. And I can’t seem to match my breath with Adrienne because it feels so forced and unnatural and I end up out of breath and struggling... Today was frustrating because I couldn’t flow through it naturally and I ended up tensing and shaking . I’m an absolute beginner and have tried other routines from Adrienne in the past, but I can’t seem to enjoy the process when it comes to transitioning with Downward dog and putting my weight on my wrists.",Astrid Rivera,2021-01-05T13:37:24Z,0

"Adriene why are you talking so much during breathwork and meditation? I feel like you are trying to find &quot;healing&quot; words for your community, but it&#39;s still kind of your opinion about life in general. I found that really distracting, when there is no 10 seconds in a row where I can let my own thoughts flow because my mind is automatically thinking about your point of view about life and health and comparing it with mine etc... why should I do so, when I&#39;m trying to release the tense in mind during yoga? Maybe be it&#39;s my fault because I&#39;m always overthinking? I would be glad to hear your opinion on this.",flowerkassy,2021-01-05T10:08:22Z,0

"Got really busy and forgot to do yoga yesterday! So I decided to do this video tonight, and man this video has helped me a whole lot. The idea of arriving with every breath has helped me feel more light and it made me feel as if I have the ability to feel safe in my own head. It sounds strange haha. I needed this because I&#39;ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety since my family and I all ended up having COVID due to my dad being exposed at his work. My anxieties about COVID has made the experience worse, but this video REALLY gave me relief, and it made me feel safe in ways that I haven&#39;t been able to the past few days. Most of all it helped me breathe better (I tend to have shallow breathing when I&#39;m panicking or having anxiety). So thank you thank you thank you Adriene! I&#39;m going to do Day 3 tomorrow morning and Day 4 at night when I usually do your videos :))",Daphne,2021-01-05T07:32:41Z,0

"Hey guys! I live in Bozeman, Montana in the US. This is my first 30 day yoga challenge. I am so excited to be a part of this. I read a comment after I finished day 1 that recommended that I take note of how many views there were when I finished that day&#39;s yoga session and then to refresh the video to see how many people were doing the practice at the same time that I was. It was so cool to see that on day 1  I was joining 22,000 other people from around the world doing the same yoga practice. It was so rad!! So today I just finished doing day 2 (I am behind 1 day, but I am being gentle and patient with myself about not having to do it all &quot;perfect&quot; ). The truth is I just practiced yoga with 14,000 other people. So cool!! You should try checking out how many others were doing yoga together virtually with you too :) <br />Take care, enjoy!!

"I counted the seconds for the pose at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaL3YF1vY2k&amp;t=22m16s"">22:16</a> ... it is 35 seconds. How many breaths are then? 15? But should a pose that gets so much tension really be maintained for so long in yoga? I mean lifting on the tip of your foot, the whole weight of the body on the wrists, the muscle of the one leg high... I love this channel so much but sometimes I get the impression that with the talk the practice loses a bit its yoga flow, and becomes something bodily hard. Not saying that hard is bad, but just that it has to have a dimension of righteousness, and those 35 seconds to me say the opposite.",ipercalisse,2021-01-04T21:50:31Z,0

"I love the idea of arriving with every inhale! :)<br />On the one hand, because when I&#39;m arriving in a pose, I&#39;m checking how my body is, if I need to shift something. And I tend to forget that when I&#39;m holding a pose. But with a new arrival/a new beginning every inhale, I&#39;m checking my body parts, my muscels, my mind every time I inhale and therefore do the exercises more precise and definitely more present :)<br />And on the other hand, a new arrival at every inhale also means, that I don&#39;t need to stay, I can walk away at every exhale. And we agreed that showing up is the hardest part. So what I mean is that I was greatful for myself not only to show up, but also to decide every single inhalte to stay and continue the journey.",xDDDx333,2021-01-04T17:07:01Z,0

"I usually skip fetal pose -- I feel so vulnerable in it. Today, I felt strong enough to end with it along with the video. I imagined how we begin in this pose, then grow up tall like seeds, and mammals, and reptiles and -- insects? Maybe insects, too. We begin in this pose. Yes, this video was a challenge -- I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who felt that! -- but that pressure gave me the space for such a sweet release at the end, like I haven&#39;t been able to do before.

I can’t even find the words. My breath was so deep and fulfilling I surprised myself. It felt amazing and I have decided to let go of my worries. Everything’s as it should be. There’s nothing I can do about it but the only thing I can control is my breath, how I use it to feel better and stronger. <br />It was a beautiful practice and I love the fact that there are new poses and little exercises that I haven’t encountered before in my last four years with Adriene.

"The slow momentum and holding of postures enables you to be in the pose correctly and to take the time to gain strength. When flow moves to quickly, you don’t have the opportunity to be in the pose and gain/learn from it. It feels to me that you are just doing it to get it done.  I love this slow series; I feel grounded and stronger and for me that is the purpose of yoga.  Thanks so much Adriene.  This is beautiful.",barb harkness,2021-01-04T12:24:16Z,0

"because i was distracted today and because these poses and maintaining them were challenging for me i think i learned many lessons through a metaphors, for example that even in the face of challenges when i&#39;m struggling to keep up i can still get through things, and with each new challenge i&#39;m starting again, with each breath giving myself a chance to connect with my inner peace and from that place take the challenges with a renewed fresh courage knowing i can deal with them. my concentration was off and i connected again and again and it felt like arriving again and again and i could always come back to myself even after i drifted away, even when i felt i wasn&#39;t given a break, like it happens in life outside of the mat many times as well 😊 i think i&#39;m not explaining it well but i think it&#39;s a uselful mindset for my life. this was a nice lesson for me. and i feel really good and warm and calm and proud now. thank you adriene! 😊❤",DontTouchMyCorn,2021-01-04T11:27:50Z,1

"The comments saying this video was difficult definitely intimidated me. I waited until nearly one in the morning to finally do this thing, literally putting it off until the last second, but I refused to skip a day due to fear. I am SO GLAD I DID THIS. Honestly, yoga has been annoying me lately. Yoga, typical meditation, all that Jazz, just makes me super irritable. And honestly it’s been like that all of 2020 and tonight I finally realized that it’s okay to feel like that. Because I found the source for me is because I’ve spent so long just sitting. Waiting. Breathing through it all- I’ve wanted to ACT. Burn. In all areas of my life.<br /><br />Recently I’ve wanted to lose weight and reset my body so I turned to water fasting like I normally do. I got annoyed with that, so I’m eating healthy and doing Pilates and 2x yoga- and I feel great. I felt stuck at my job so after SO LONG I  got a new one and now I feel great there too. And so the annoyance I’ve been getting with yoga and meditation is just because I want to DO more, and this video did that for me. <br /><br />A perfect balance of activating muscles 💪 and your brain 🧠 and ❤️. It made me feel like I was DOING something rather than just looking inward. I’ve looked inward for so long that it started staring back at me telling me to do something else. I’m rambling now with no point so I’m going to go journal before bed. But YES, do this video. Feel the burn, feel ALIVE.",liljubsy,2021-01-04T08:33:57Z,0

"This was so lovely. I had very low energy today coming off of working 12 hours over the past 24 hours, with a rough night&#39;s sleep the past two nights. I thought it perhaps better to just rest and skip yoga today, but I wanted to stay committed. I could only do half the practice, the rest spent in child&#39;s pose or hero&#39;s pose, just breathing. Still, I stayed present, arriving with each breath. In the fetal position at the end I was reminded that I am always worthy of arriving to the party, exactly as I am, and that is enough. :) Off to sleep! Thank you Adriene!!

I know that we&#39;ve got it this time! No matter how many &quot;days&quot; it takes, I know that we&#39;ll both finish and we&#39;ll have a wonderful journey along the way! Also - practicing Day 2 today and my boyfriend joined about 10 minutes in. What an amazing surprise for me!

"Thank you a lot for this video Adriene! <br />It made me really realize I wasn&#39;t paying that much attention to the breath even though I started my journey with yoga 4 years ago. Because of the lack of sleep on the last days, I felt less concentrated and my mind had a tendency to drift off but after a while, I was catching the moment I&#39;ve lost the concentration, and I was going backwards to the point I got lost. Now thanks to that practise I know I need to organize myself better to have more time and most importantly get some proper rest and sleep :)<br />See you tomorrow on the mat again :)",Adrian Smykowski,2021-01-04T05:09:22Z,0

"I have two young daughters, and a personal crisis is currently unfolding in my family of origin, so I&#39;ve been up late the last two nights - after everyone else in the house has gone to sleep - in order to keep this commitment to myself and discover how a daily yoga practice would serve me in a different way than my usual sporadic one. So far, so good! I&#39;ve felt great following both so far.

What is the name of the pose where you sit back on your heels with toes curled under? How do you modify it? I can only do it in a kneeing position. I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s my knees or toes (perhaps both?) that won&#39;t permit me to sit back.,Blandyna Williams,2021-01-04T03:27:29Z,0
@Abby Fenwick Thank you. I think a block will allow me to sit back a little.,Blandyna Williams,2021-01-04T13:48:07Z,0
I believe it&#39;s a variation of vajrasana. I find it too hard on my feet to curl my toes under so I just uncurl them and sit on my ankles/soles. You might also like to place a yoga block or blanket under your bum if it&#39;s hard on your knees to sit all the way down. I hope you had a good practice today :),Abby Fenwick,2021-01-04T03:32:41Z,1

Also, knowing that I&#39;m completing this practice not only on my own time but also with so many people across the world, brought me back to that feeling of why I love yoga so much. I miss the community of being jammed packed in a hot yoga studio, people stepping on my mat, me stepping on other people&#39;s mats, hearing everyone breathing, sweat everywhere lol but honestly I miss it sooooo much. Hopefully we can back to that soon but for now this journey has already made me feel somewhat back at home.

Hi Julia! I&#39;m assuming you mean pain in the seated meditation pose - I have the exact same issue! Sometimes I find it helpful to place a pillow underneath me so my hips are higher up than my knees. I also often do a sort of cat/cow stretch when I&#39;m seated to give my back a little of a break or even sit against a wall to take some of the pressure off if I really need it. There&#39;s also the option of sitting in a chair too! I hope you had a good practice today :),Abby Fenwick,2021-01-04T03:43:44Z,1

"I felt so present in this practice. For me, arrival is about starting new. With each arrival--each breath--I can deepen a stretch, strengthen my muscles, create a new moment for me and my body. Once I started focusing on my arrival with each breath, I realized that each plank, each cobra, each downward dog, each moment doesn&#39;t have to be like the previous. With my arrival, I can be something new; thereby, learn something new. Just in these two days, I can see how the things I learn on my mat will definitely be coming with me off my mat.",Olivia Rigby,2021-01-04T02:25:17Z,0

"For the first time in I don&#39;t know how many years, I did not sign up for a mileage based challenge.  I have spent years pushing my body trying to hit 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 miles per year.  Every year I do my best and every year I fail to reach the goal.  Throughout the years I&#39;ve had to overcome pneumonia, knee issues, feet issues, ridiculously long work hours, a head injury, and this year, a torn calf.  The torn calf led me to the Home journey from last year.  Finally I felt peace when I exercised.  After thirty days, my knees, feet, and calf felt better.  The practice didn&#39;t aggravate my injured brain.  I didn&#39;t have to overcome anything.  I just felt good - not as stiff, stronger, and just better about myself.  So this year, I didn&#39;t sign up for any mileage based challenge.  I&#39;m going to focus on yoga and walk three times a week.  I&#39;m going to not push myself through pain.  Imagine that?  I&#39;m going to see what happens when I honor and listen to my body rather than ignore everything it&#39;s trying to tell me.  Today was wonderful.  I am no yoga guru.  I still can&#39;t sweep my leg all the way through to a lunge but I can get to one and do one pretty darn well once I&#39;m there!  Hahaha.  Each day I do my best and for once, I know that this is enough.  I am enjoying the journey.  Thank you Adrienne.  I am forever grateful for my torn calf because it led me to your page.  &lt;3",Barbara Myers,2021-01-04T02:14:55Z,0

"This is just what I need!  I used to practice pretty regularly, but summer before last I both went back to grad school and broke my leg.  Technically, I&#39;m all healed up and cleared to do what I want, but am still so stiff and sometimes numb.  Between these two life events and COVID, I&#39;ve gained a ton of weight, and it&#39;s all belly fat.  I think it&#39;s the stress, and so when I had the chance to join this 30 days of yoga, I jumped on it.  Granted, I&#39;m on semester break right now, but I still feel so much more relaxed after just two days, and more flexible, too.  Love the focus on breath and new beginnings.

"that was easier than yesterday, but still challenging! ngl i was almost killed by the plank<br />love that there&#39;s more attention to the wrists this month, mine aren&#39;t the strongest yet so i appreciate added stretching<br />i seem to have a slight problem: when moving from plank to downward facing dog, i feel something like a jolt of electricity in my lower back. does anyone know what that&#39;s about and what can i do about it?",Анастасия Макарович,2021-01-04T01:06:36Z,0

You are right it is the hardest part for me anyway, so I’m going to stop kicking myself IF I miss. It’s reassuring, really.

I try not to get frustrated with myself about not being as fluid in movement or breaths moving too quickly because I&#39;m working hard. Or that some things aren&#39;t as easy because I&#39;m a bigger lady. BUT I get through it every time and do what I can the best I can. It&#39;s only been a month I&#39;ve been doing daily yoga and I have a goal and it&#39;ll take me a long while to get there. We all are at different places. I cannot expect my body to move like another&#39;s. We are all here and we are all beautiful in our movement even when we think we are not. We are moving and we are breathing. 💗 We are lucky.,Autumn Lewis,2021-01-04T00:59:05Z,1

"After hours of working on my feet for minimum wage, I kept telling myself that I “promised Adrienne” that I was going to show up today. After a quick nap, I got on my mat and made it all the way through feeling strong and powerful that I arrived. I also definitely cried lol I discovered your channel during COVID and you and yoga (and Benji!) saved my life. Focused breathing can quicken my heart rate because of my anxiety. Because of you I am finally able to tap into it, and trust myself and feel how healing it is. Thank you and Love you Andriene for all that you do for us!

"&quot;arrive&quot; is just the theme i needed!! meditation is very challenging and feels unnatural for me, as is simply being &quot;present&quot; - my brain feels like an angry panicked animal that lunges away crazily every time i try to rein it in. so i&#39;ve always shied away from that kind of mindfulness despite knowing how much it might help. but &quot;arrive&quot; is perfect, because implicit in the idea of &quot;arrive with each breath&quot; is the idea that you might have wandered away in the meantime. the emphasis isn&#39;t on <b>staying</b> there, just <b>starting</b> there, getting your foot in the door, over and over and over again. it feels unintimidating and possible. i did this video first thing this morning and i&#39;ve practiced &quot;arriving&quot; all day - as i load laundry, as i microwave food, as i type this comment. just taking a deep breath and arriving where i am, knowing that it&#39;s okay if i float away again a minute later, because i can come back again.  i&#39;m so excited to hang onto this word and keep exploring in the rest of this month.",otempora16,2021-01-04T00:26:53Z,0

"<b>BREATH Day 2</b><br /><br />I always feel kinda set back when I see a 30+ mins session, but I also keep in my mind “the hardest part is showing up.”<br />Actually it felt shorter and was quite a relaxing way of ending my day before going to bed.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ywabreath"">#ywaBREATH</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fwfg"">#FWFG</a>",DAWSAC,2021-01-04T00:07:41Z,0
"I feel somewhat better reading your recommendation to make showing up on the mat the #1 goal. Today&#39;s session was physically challenging for me. Perhaps a month from now it won&#39;t be.<br />I cannot seem to get Closed Captioning with these sessions. Yes know it seems intuitive that if your face is in mat or eyes closed you cannot read the captions. However through the magic of computers if I feel I am missing something I could rewind and play back.  If I cannot understand what you said the first time its doubtful with my type of hearing impairment that listening twice or a thousand times would matter. I am using wireless headphones along with hearing aids. Hearing loss has removed me from many activities that I used to enjoy. I hope that yoga class isn&#39;t going on the list with:  working as a nurse,  live concerts, Movies at a Theater, enjoying a night out with friends, having a normal conversation around the dinner table. All things deafness has irrevocably ruined for me. I&#39;m only 62, hearing aids since age 42.",Sharie Stranathan,2021-01-04T00:06:40Z,0

"I started feeling pretty sore from my first cross country ski session of the year 2 days ago, and a hard return at work today (I&#39;m a massage therapist). Showing up was definitely the hardest part. Here&#39;s to starting a session feeling crippled to finishing it feeling in tune with our body again! Side note: I sure felt a real good fascial stretch onto the brachial plexus with that first neck shoulder stretch. It almost felt like a &quot;nerve flossing&quot; technique like I use in massage therapy treatment.",Marieve Daze,2021-01-04T00:06:24Z,0

"I discovered this channel a couple of months ago, so I got really excited about this 30 day challenge! At first, I was a bit concerned that they were longer than I had hoped and wondered if I was gonna be able to take that much time out of my routine. In day 1 and 2, I ended both practices with saying to myself, &quot;oh wow, we&#39;re done already!&quot; It&#39;s great to be able to prove to myself that I can take some time out for myself. Arriving on the mat is certainly the hardest part, but I&#39;ve been spending less and less time trying to talk myself out of it. I&#39;m so excited for the rest of the month! ☺️☺️☺️",Taylor Laviera,2021-01-03T23:41:25Z,0

"As some encouragement to others, I want to say that having started a 30 Day Yoga Challenge with a group of friends on Zoom during the first lockdown here in Canada, we kept on going and going! So I guess that it became a 9 month yoga challenge! And while I could barely master a plank or vinyassa back then,  today&#39;s practice just felt good.

"I found it hard to get here today. I’ve been doing your camps since 2016, on and off (mostly off), But I got back into the full swing in august and have done all the yoga camps out so far in preparation for this one. I was so sedentary during the first lockdown that my body started aching from not moving. It feels so weird to have conflicting feelings on coming back to the mat. I know yoga is good for me, I’ve seen the results, FELT the results, and more important than that, I enjoy doing this. But it’s still hard. I have a lot of days where I catch myself thinking “I don’t want to do this today” but I’ve shown up regardless for the past 5 months. I always think this will get easier but I guess it’s not about it getting easier, just accepting that I do this for me and my wellbeing, and as long as it impacts me positively it’s worth doing. All this is an extremely long-winded way of saying thank you. Your dedication to this program, regardless of the why, allows me to bring wellbeing into my life.",4L3X4ND3R98,2021-01-03T22:53:14Z,1

"I have done several of Adriene&#39;s 30 day yoga journeys, and this time I have felt resistant at times, almost as if I am resisting the commitment.  I know this is counterintuitive, so  each day&#39;s encouragement to &quot;just show up&quot; is so encouraging.  At the start of the practices I am noticing some discomfort in my upper back, despite using a blanket under my hips, and I think I am really paying attention to sitting up straight.  Does anyone else have this issue, and if so, what helps with that discomfort at the beginning?",Kristen Brey,2021-01-03T22:12:40Z,0
"I have pain in my back when sitting straight and being still for a long time like in the beginning is very difficult. I try to hold it as long as possible (comfortably) and then do small movements (circles/flex/curve spine) to loosen it up if it gets tight/try to relax and then go back to it when it feels better, in the previous 30 day journey I did, it did improve over time and is all about practice.

Really happy to be doing this in real time with everyone in 2021. My partner and I did the Home 30 day during U.K. covid lockdown - and practising with Adriene (and you all!) has been an oasis in both troubled and calm times ever since. We’re in this together. 💚,Gaijin Girl,2021-01-03T21:33:43Z,1

"Good to remember that yoga practice is a metaphor for life and sometimes it&#39;s a literal reminder: Breathe, show up, be flexible, adapt as necessary, take risks, find balance, take a rest, challenge yourself, notice when you&#39;re stressed, notice when you&#39;ve improved, etc. We just need to know when and how to do any of these things at any moment when we listen to our bodies and minds. I write this not from the point of view of being an expert, but because this is what I&#39;m working on.",Dave Edson,2021-01-03T21:26:35Z,0

"I’m 69 and was diagnosed with osteoporosis so I put my yoga on hold and began to do a lifting class, BodyPump, by Les Mills, at my club. I also started doing BodyFlow, another Les Mills class. It combines Tai Chi moves with yoga and core work. After 4 months I noticed I had developed tennis elbow. it was painful and I had to stop using it for a few weeks. I decided not to do any more BodyPump classes, and am replacing it with yoga once again. I will continue BodyFlow but NO MORE HEAVY LIFTING. It’s so sad when we work to get fitter only to injure ourselves. Yoga is so much gentler yet still challenges me. Adriene, your class has been a lifesaver during Covid. I know I speak for a lot of people when I say this. I see that you have become much calmer over the years and seem more mature. I wonder if you will decide to go on a sabbatical to India at some point, lol. I love your funny asides or when you sing a song related to what you’re doing or saying. As a musician I often think about doing the same thing but find myself holding back. Why? We should all be feeling free to sing whenever we feel it,  but most of us are too uptight, I guess. Anyway, thanks for being your wonderful free-spirited self and let’s keep doing this for a long long time! SoundCloud: Summerfly,el-and-al",Elizabeth Hudetz,2021-01-03T21:26:05Z,0

I’m starting to understand that sense of arriving and the breath being the Spirt- mentioned in another video by Adriene. At first I couldn’t understand that concept, but after loosing someone close and my family releasing they had passed by the absence of breath (peacefully I should add), I’m getting there with seeing just how important it is.",Bex Lawlor,2021-01-03T21:23:01Z,0

"Today I was struck by how arriving in each moment made me forget about whether I was doing something &quot;correctly&quot;. I struggle with perfectionism, and this practise made me come to a realisation that in striving for perfection with sacrifice so much. We sacrifice the present moment, and what really exists, rather than savour it, embrace it, and nurture it. Think of all the thing you don&#39;t notice because you&#39;re think about whteher you&#39;re doing something perfectly. I&#39;m making a commitment to arrive at every moment more often.",Amy Rushent,2021-01-03T21:17:57Z,48

However, when I thought &quot;phew, my wrists are so weak&quot;, I took a moment to realize that when I started practicing last year I could barely do downward facing dog for longer than two seconds, and here I am holding those poses, keeping myself up in plank even though mountain climbers are not something I can do with integrity just yet.

"Remember that it&#39;s okay to modify.  If plank pose is too hard, you can do table pose.  Do not worry if you can&#39;t do a pose right away.  I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for 14 years and there are still some poses I can not do.  It&#39;s about being present and the breath.   You just keep practicing.  Try the pose a little bit every time you practice.  Modify when you need.  Someday, you might get it.   There are some poses that I can do now that I couldn&#39;t do when I first started.  I just laughed like &quot; Ya right, sure!&quot; .   Then one day, I did it!   Just breath, do what you can.  That is all that matters.",Shell S,2021-01-04T01:52:07Z,3

"thank you Adriene for sharing your energy, time, and light with all of us. I loved this practice, especially your cues to take pressure out of the wrists while in plank. In the seated forward fold after the planks, I felt emotional as I considered the muscles I&#39;m developing through consistent practice and how I also grow stronger, working to take your lessons (such as every breath being a new arrival) off of the mat. I will bring the patience and grace I felt through this practice with me throughout the rest of my day and I&#39;ll see you again tomorrow &lt;3",Nadia,2021-01-03T20:47:13Z,0

Really looking forward to this every morning. It’s crazy how simple each move seems but the feeling is far from that. It was crazy how connected I felt with you during the stretch in the beginning, where you tilt your head to one side and reach the opposite arm. The feelings I got during that stretch was just astounding. Cant wait for day 3! What a way to start my year.",Nicole Kasprzyk,2021-01-03T20:42:54Z,0

So, I appreciate taking some time to settle into each practice in order to prepare my mind and body for some movement.

"I just have to say that the people who are practicing this and commenting are brightening my day.  I was so surprised and not to be too dramatic but a little horrified with yoga as it was practiced in my gym..instructors yelling for people to go faster, do more, not have a drink of water even when the room was over 105, calling people out...and the participants playing on their phones and just wanting a vigorous practice to lose weight and get toned.

"I&#39;m a day behind, but I wish you could see this beautiful Saturday early afternoon in Denver on my 3rd floor deck.

"I am a high school student. Recently, I started doing yoga. I believed it has been already 2-3 weeks.  I noticed that since I started yoga practice, I usually heard the sound of &quot;crack&quot; in my bones, even though there was a no pain or hurting every time the crack occurred. Sometime, I just move my body to take a book or head to the kitchen or doing some daily basic activities, the bones cracked. Is that the normal phenomenon for a yoga beginner?

Hi Adrienne and thank you for Breath! I am already hooked 😊. I have a question about the breathing: before Breath I have always breathed in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Today I felt the power of breath. These 2 days have been hard. The hardst part hasn&#39;t been showing up but too keep going. My mind just keeps telling me that it is hard and that it wants too stop or get out of the pose. But halfway thru the video the arriving with a new breath started to work. And I was able too quiet my mind and just breathe and stay in the pose. Thethat last plank made it really hard. But I made it!,Miranda,2021-01-03T18:50:49Z,0

I thought about my mum&#39;s last days during this practice. I allowed the thoughts and the tears to come rather than pushing them away (usual reaction is to suppress). As the tears flowed I kept breathing. Arriving. Emotion needs to move through the body and boy, will a lot of emotion be moved through this unbelievable gift. So grateful to Adriene and team.

"The hardest part is truly showing up and I am always in a better mental space when I do. One or more of my kids will also show up and craw underneath my downward dogs, or snuggle into my lap when I am finding my breath to watch and learn what moms yoga is all about.

"Day 2 of practicing with hypermobility (possible and very likely hEDS- a connective tissue disorder which manifests in hypermobile joints (frequent dislocations) and skin, and other symptoms like heart palpitations, digestive issues, chronic pain and fatigue that can be more harm than good when it comes to exercise like yoga, which is often given as a recommendation if you experience chronic pain (as it was given to me when I was told I had fibromyalgia, as no one had noticed my hypermobility), as those with hypermobile joints can very easily overextend these joints or destabalise them, making them feel worse, rather than finding the practice useful and soothing, there&#39;s a confusion between flexibility and hypermobility, something I didn&#39;t understand for a long time and I&#39;m still getting used to with my new awareness of my symptoms and my joints.))- I&#39;m doing this as not only do I want something to help me bring awareness to my breath, but to my body, and how I can modify practices to make sure I don&#39;t cause my body more injury. Today I:<br />- cried at the very beginning with the &#39;arrival of breath&#39; and welcoming it etc- yay for emotional release<br />- halfway through the practice I put my wrist braces on, as I was feeling a lot of pain and strain in them- they&#39;re the soft types, without a metal insert. these did help marginally but did hinder putting my whole hands on the ground, and didn&#39;t stop strain being put on my fingers as they&#39;re only support for the wrists)<br />- put a blanket under my knees at all times, whether I was in a tabletop position, or straightening my legs to make sure I wasn&#39;t overextending or putting stress on my knees. I also in the sitting down forward fold didn&#39;t keep my knees on the ground or blanket as I knew I can do that- but in doing so overextending my knees, so I bent them instead to keep them safe)<br />- tried to be mindful of where my hands were in relation to my shoulders (very difficult), and where my shoulders were in relation to my ribs and neck and ears (weird way to put it but basically- was my shoulder still where my shoulder should SAFELY be, not where it could go if I let it)<br />- tried to be mindful of always keeping the slightest of bends in the elbow, making sure my elbows didn&#39;t over extend <br />- took frequent breaks, even if it meant I missed a move or two- I know yoga is useful for building strength, but I also kept in mind that pain doesn&#39;t always necessarily equal that building of strength, and could mean the move isn&#39;t a wise choice for my body<br />- I can&#39;t use my fingers to prop myself up as they&#39;re very hypermobile, so attempted to use my whole hand (keeping a slight bend in the elbow) or with my hand in a fist, on my knuckles<br />- managed the whole session with only one actual pause of the video- whereas yesterday I needed several<br />all of this was done at the expense of not keeping my thought on the breath at all times, because it&#39;s quite a task trying to keep track of everything, but I think I&#39;ll keep going with the wrist braces, and keep them in the braces before and after the session, and keep an eye on them, as well as my fingers, elbows and shoulders, which do hurt a bit more than I think they should, especially my fingers, to see if too much stress has been put on them already. If I find they&#39;re injured ice and rest shall be applied. I think I did much better than I did yesterday in terms of noticing things I could do to improve my experience, keep my body safe, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly how it was instructed, or took away from my awareness of breath, because at the end of the day, can&#39;t breathe if the body can&#39;t quite breathe with it y&#39;know? I have no clue if anyone will read this or anyone with hypermobile joints specifically will and has any advice or finds this helpful but I was told for YEARS before I knew hEDS was a possibility and I was hypermobile that my chronic pain could basically be cured very magically by exercise- specifically yoga, by doctors and friends and physio and pretty much everyone, and it wasn&#39;t until someone noticed I was hypermobile I realised that I was doing myself a disservice because I was overextending everything while doing this exercise, leading to much more pain, and that my body was not compatible with yoga- but I&#39;m attempting to find out if I can MAKE yoga compatible, if I can become aware of which of my joints do what, what symptoms flare during or after, how can I fix that etc.",lxlliby,2021-01-03T18:39:20Z,0

"Did HOME in April, being a total yoga rookie, and I continued with the rest of your 30/31 days of yoga. After that I just did yoga through the monthy calendars or random videos, sometimes even trying free practice with the many tools  you give us. I haven&#39;t skipped yoga since and was so excited to join &quot;LIVE&quot;  the new 30 days. Thanks Adriene, you&#39;ve helped my mental health, breath, discipline and acceptance inmenseley. Also I&#39;ve gained 5 kilos of muscle and a lot of strenght and gratitude. Still, I feel like I have everything to learn every day. Anyway, thanks for another wonderful present!",Rocío Montaño,2021-01-03T18:34:07Z,50

I am missing Adriene&#39;s energetic voice a little bit. She has chosen to do it all a bit more zen and slowing down her voice a lot. I will continue breath as I had set the goal but I hope she will return to the energetic motivating way of doing the videos that have made my days during the pandemic. I think her videos have kept me so positive and feeling good! Thanks x,Jessica Colours of Latin America,2021-01-03T18:31:33Z,0

"I think I am finally accepting that, right now, with the current state of my body, I cannot do these yearly 30 day journeys. No amount of props or modifications will make 30 days of very active flows accessible to me at this time. I cried 3 times out of frustration doing day 1 yesterday and today had to skip about 20 minutes of the 37 minute video today, and have had very potent feelings of guilt and anger because the same thing has happened every January the past few years; where I am unable to do these classes and still receive the daily email which just felt like a daily reminder of what I can&#39;t do. For the first time, though, thanks to Adriene&#39;s guidance, the comments section, and my own growth, I am able to identify all of this. Instead of anguishing that I can&#39;t participate in the BREATH journey with ease I am going to pivot and instead commit to 30 days of Adriene&#39;s relaxing/cozy/restorative practices. I will be cheering y&#39;all on and joining when I can, but for now I am looking forward to 30 days of gentle yoga &lt;3",Em Adele Oppman,2021-01-03T18:28:35Z,1

"Every time Adriene does a 30 days of yoga series, I tell myself I&#39;ll do it. But every time, I don&#39;t manage it. As soon as I&#39;ve done the first one, I skip practices, dip in and out, and often just disappear for the whole 30 days and ignore the calendar on my wall. But this time I&#39;m determined to do it! I need to prove to myself that I can commit to something. Both yesterday and today I almost didn&#39;t show up. I thought the practices were too long (&quot;how on earth will I fit that into my day?!&quot; *proceeds to scroll on twitter for 2 hours*), and then this one today looked hard. But I gritted my teeth and showed up. (As soon as I made it to the mat it was so fulfilling!) I know that if I want to do it this time, there can be no allowances or skipped days.

I have always struggled with discipline and the part of showing up. But this has already become a very relaxing habit at night where I just light up my candles and arrive on the mat to share this practice and after I am finished I read the comments which motivate me even more. Loving this series by far and I am very excited for whats about to come. :) Thank you Adriene and everyone for leaving such nice and positive comments for me to read after practice.

"Thank you for the Day 2 practice Adriene! I really tried my best to focus on using each breath as a chance to arrive and start anew. I found this was a good way to keep my mind focused on being present and I had less moments where I was trailing away in my thoughts! My body is feeling that &quot;slow burn&quot; from yesterday still, but I am proud of myself for showing up to the mat and giving myself another chance to begin my day with breath. Cheers to the rest of this journey! 💙",Faith Hudvagner,2021-01-03T17:54:45Z,1
My goal for 2021 has been to get my health and strength back on track. I&#39;ve been doing Adrienne&#39;s videos for a while to build up the basics. This is my first time doing it live with everyone and it&#39;s so great to see such an active community here.,Courtney Stearns,2021-01-03T17:54:31Z,1
"Wow! I’ve known that every day was a new beginning, every moment was a new beginning but  every breath a new arrival really helps to clarify the power of now and that we have. <br />I came across this practice over a month ago when being a lifelong athlete, I couldn’t workout due to a surgical procedure but my mind and body needed something. What a gift this has been at this point in my life, and it is exactly what I needed as we look to grow in all areas of our lives.

"I&#39;m amazed by how, inevitably, every time I begin my practice I am, in a way, &quot;faking it before I make it.&quot; I guess that&#39;s just another way to say showing up is the hardest thing, but also inevitably, after 10 or so minutes of conscious breath, my body is there, my mind is more present, and I feel better.

"Practiced during a snowy mid-afternoon looking out at my backyard. During plank: &quot;I can do hard things, I choose to stay, I choose to arrive&quot;.

"The idea of treating each breath as a new arrival really resonated with me today. Whether it&#39;s because of exhaustion or impatience, sometimes these longer videos can be a struggle for me. I get caught up in thinking about how long it&#39;s been, what I need to get done today, that I don&#39;t have it in me to finish, etc. But by choosing to arrive new, I can think of this time as a collection of valuable moments. I&#39;m not &quot;getting through&quot; the video, I&#39;m continuously beginning something new. And it always helps to use those moments to remind myself that this is the most important thing I&#39;ll do for myself all day. Thanks for this one, Adriene!!",Maili Knox,2021-01-03T17:47:08Z,0

"Today was especially difficult to arrive on the mat (hard PMS day) but I&#39;m happy I still showed up. Today, arriving with my breath meant that with each pose that felt impossible, or each moment where I felt like I wanted to stop, I would approach each &quot;new arrival&quot; as if it was my first pose of the day, my first movement of the day. That helped me ease so much into it without feeling any judgment if I got any previous poses wrong or had to cut them short cause my body could only handle so much.

"Today is honestly a really hard day for me as it marks a sad anniversary. I woke up angry that it&#39;s a normal day with things to do because it seems unfair to pretend everything is normal when it&#39;s not. Today&#39;s &quot;arrive&quot; theme caught me off-guard and I didn&#39;t know how much I needed it. After completing the practice I&#39;m starting to accept that I have plans today, and it&#39;s not an injustice to keep moving forward. One breath at a time, I can arrive in the present moment, and I can still mourn and honor past events while living my present life. Thank you so much Adriene, and thank you to everyone in this community for doing this practice with me, because today is a lonely day and I&#39;m grateful to have some company.",fooferdoodles,2021-01-03T17:35:07Z,0

"That moment when I put my fingers on my ribcage and felt them expand as I breathed in...just wow. I thought I knew what lateral breathing meant..and I guess I did know what it meant intellectually, but having my fingers there and actually FEELING MY RIBS MOVE to make way for the breath was a powerful experience that left me grinning for the rest of the practice.

"Did a 30 minute run, came home and did this practice. Now I feel on cloud 9. This is the perfect workout I needed. I feel soothed and like Adriene said, it is something different every day.

Lovely practice. I left my leg on the floor for the low lunge and managed to just sustain the plank. After doing yoga every day for the last few months my strength has improved dramatically. It’s important to remember it’s not a competition and to always listen to your body and be guided by it. Improvement will definitely come with regular practice.,Janet Carling,2021-01-03T17:15:51Z,0

Day 2 in the books. I was feeling sore muscles this morning from yesterday’s practice but showed up if only to breath. I managed to follow along with the practice today ...taking breaks when I needed to. I am feeling less and less hard on myself if I can’t do it all as long as the instructor. I am realizing I am enough to be present and to try. Thank you Adrianne for motivating me on this journey!,Marwin Davies,2021-01-03T16:55:11Z,0
"Showing up is definitely hard when you know that you need to carve out another niche of time among all the other to do’s on your list. However our bodies are God’s temple, so they need to be taken care of. Last plank was difficult.  Stayed almost to the end and then dropped down to a modified plank. Looking forward to tomorrow.",Diane Tanski,2021-01-03T16:54:51Z,0

"As a professional musician (flutist), the theme of this 30 day journey early speaks to me.  Breath is essential to living fully but also to playing my flute.  Normally at this time of year, I’m busy rehearsing and performing, but because of COVID, I’m unemployed and searching for a musical outlet.  These two days have already been physically challenging for me, even though I’ve practiced yoga for many years.   However, so far, it’s helped me to focus and stay calm and feel good during this time of isolation.  I’m looking forward to each new day, so Thank you Adrienne.","Beth Larsen, Flute",2021-01-03T16:38:00Z,1

"Reading everyone&#39;s comments is like a warm embrace. I have been struggling with body issues lately and to see people with such kind comments saying &quot;we&#39;re in this together!&quot; or like &quot;yoga isn&#39;t a competition. honor your body, mind, and soul&quot; made me shed a tear. Yoga may be seen as another source to strengthen the body but people forget that it also strengthens our mind, heart, and soul. To be honest, it is rare to find good yoga videos that help us relax, meditate, and be present. Most of the time it is for &quot;vigorous&quot; exercises or simply sequences to just do the poses, never attending to our minds and feelings. I know it&#39;s just  a matter of preference but I feel like people should also take the time to be mindful of our thoughts not just do chaturangas and whatnot. This is a biased comment but I do hope people rlly spare time to notice their feelings and thoughts than their physical actions. Im truly grateful for YWA and its community. They teach us to honor our feelings whilst doing yoga. I love that!! sorry if sound pretty demanding I would consider myself bad at expressing myself but I hope my intentions are clear 😅 have an awesome 2021!!",sunnie tyler,2021-01-03T15:52:10Z,0

Anyways, this series feels so healing to me, it feels like its whispering a response to that question that I’ve been asking. I always think of something you said in another yoga video you had done before, which is presenting the idea of breath being the spirit.

I am a high school English teacher, and this year has put me through the ringer in a way it never has before. Well, 2020 did that for everyone!

"day 2<br />jan 2, 2021 <br />11:29 PM<br />---- 🌞---- <br />Today&#39;s practice was an eye-opener. I realized what my problem really was: &quot;stuck and dwelling in the past&quot;. Back in early 2020, I exercised daily, did yoga daily, ate healthy foods, drank plenty of water until more food and celebrations came in. I realized how ungrateful i was. I didn&#39;t see them as blessings. I saw them as objects that &quot;ruined&quot; me, things that would make me &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;unhealthy&quot; when in fact, it was just the feeling of guilt. I didn&#39;t want to admit that I enjoyed the delicious food. And then I stopped doing my daily habits, came the mental break downs and such. I hated myself. &quot;Why can&#39;t I be the way I was before? I was smaller and prettier&quot; I tried exercising again but the thoughts of failing just came back. I was so invested in the past and what my imaginable future could look like that I didn&#39;t realize where I truly was, the present moment. It made me so lost. so It was my resolution for the new year&#39;s to go back to my old ways. Little did I actually know, those old ways were self-destructive. I only wanted to go back to my old ways to look &quot;prettier&quot; This practice really reminded me that it is not to go back to old ways and to embrace the present moment and breathe in for a new start. NEW START. I was so deep in the past. An exit was not to be found. but this practice made me escape. Thank you Adriene for giving me a door to open and ARRIVE in my new beginnings.

"It&#39;s absolutely true that showing up is the hardest part and for sure it&#39;s hard for me to find that motivation every single day. Here&#39;s a tip that I sometimes use to make myself commit to those &#39;hard&#39; things like showing up for yoga or doing daily piano practice, for example. That is - just roll out your mat / sit down and decide to do 5 minutes. Literally just five minutes. Most likely you&#39;ll keep going and do the whole thing, but lets say it really isn&#39;t your day and everything is too hard - worst case you&#39;ve done 5 minutes of breathing and neck rolls or 5 minutes of scales (or whatever). How bad is that? Of course it&#39;s not perfect but even 5 minutes is better than nothing at all. Hope that helps! x",Alexandra Panico,2021-01-03T15:28:56Z,0

"Adriene, I love that you send an email each day.  I wake up with the anticipation of opening it to read your encouraging words and see what you have in store. Having your message waiting in my inbox prompts me to get out of bed when my alarm goes off and hit the mat.  Thank you!!",Shannon McGhee,2021-01-03T14:53:13Z,1
"Anxiety has been overwhelming me lately. During today&#39;s practice, I asked myself what it would feel like if I &quot;arrived&quot; on the mat as someone without worries, and pretended to be that person. First time I&#39;ve felt peace within my body and mind in a while. Sometimes you gotta fake it &#39;til you make it. Cheers 🥂!",Abby Neff,2021-01-03T14:52:14Z,62

I really resonated with the analogy of arrival today, <br />I&#39;m currently doing my diploma thesis and this past year often made me feel like I&#39;m getting nowhere.  but with today&#39;s practice all I was thinking was: <br />Each inhale is a step closer, each inhale is a small arrival to the present moment where I&#39;m closer  than ever to completing my goals ! It really clicked so thank you !  Here&#39;s to all new arrivals!",Ileanna Sotiropoulou,2021-01-03T14:50:13Z,0

"Those planks hit me hard today! I&#39;m so excited to continue this month, and I&#39;m really hoping to build a little bit of my strength back up. I am an ice skater, but college has largely prevented me from practicing bc there wasn&#39;t a rink nearby. I&#39;m in a new place with a rink not too far from me, and my 2021 goal is to rebuild my strength and my skills and continue to progress in skating, because I miss it a lot. Last time I did yoga somewhat consistently was weekly yoga at the rink, but that was years ago. Excited to get back into engaging my body in ways that I haven&#39;t in a while, and feel the burn a little bit lol, but also just to relax and be present, bc that feels so good every time &lt;3",Autumn Riley,2021-01-03T14:31:33Z,2

"The reminder to &quot;arrive&quot; is one I also read recently in a technique for grounding when you&#39;re experiencing acute anxiety. You quietly tell yourself your name, what time it is, where you are, and that you are okay. It&#39;s like arriving at calm in the midst of chaos. Locating that spot even when I&#39;m feeling uncertain about sensations or postures during the practice is helpful. 💖",Carrie Meadows,2021-01-03T14:14:03Z,2

"Awesome practice today, The hardest part was showing up so I thought today I wouldn’t bc of how busy I was, but glad I made it, at first I was a little tired, but when I finished the practice I felt a little better, finding what feels good in the practice , and focusing on breathing in hard poses that require strength, made things more easier to me!

"Wow! I have been inspired by you to build my daily yoga practice now for the past five years ever since I believe what was your first 30 day challenge and today just blew me away even more than ever, which at this point I didn&#39;t think possible! For the past year I have been focused on building my soul biz, The Joyous Parent yes, in the middle of a pandemic and have had so much self doubt, uncertainty, shame for having &quot;abandoned&quot; my fellow educators in the classroom and moving around with a lot of proving energy and fear of failure. But today, when you said to simply celebrate a new beginning with each breath, I was finally and miraculously and simply able to just drop into the amazing miracle and overflowing gratitude of the wonder of what I get to do each day, even each moment. I got to the point by the end of this video that each breath was like &quot;wow, how amazing is my life!&quot; &quot;Wow, I&#39;m so blessed&quot; &quot;wow, this moment is full of so much magic and glory too!&quot; - and I realized, what a gift, if I am able to approach my biz building like THAT, then imagine how much more impact my work and passion will be for others because I will just be in celebration mode of the every amazing, beautiful, imperfect, terrifying moment of putting myself out there and embracing what comes back... I feel able to take the lessons on the mat off of it and into real life on a whole new level. And who knows what will be?! Maybe I just get to be me in this moment, and now in this moment again, and in every moment I say thank you thank you thank you for the gift of this new breath and hello to what might be and become! So thank you. From the bottom of my hear and the top of it and ALL the parts of it. Thank you!!",Sivanne Lieber,2021-01-03T12:26:59Z,0

"Had to look up the poem Adriene mentioned. Perfect for today and a good reflection for every day.<br /><br />THE GUEST HOUSE <br /><br />This being human is a guest house.<br />Every morning a new arrival.<br />A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br />some momentary awareness comes<br />as an unexpected visitor.<br /><br />Welcome and entertain them all!<br />Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br />who violently sweep your house<br />empty of its furniture,<br />still, treat each guest honorably.<br />He may be clearing you out<br />for some new delight.<br /><br />The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br />meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.<br />Be grateful for whatever comes.<br />because each has been sent<br />as a guide from beyond.<br /><br />— Jellaludin Rumi,<br />translation by Coleman Barks",Rachel Stoparczyk,2021-01-03T12:17:06Z,0

Today was slightly challenging for my wrists as I&#39;m out of practice, and I did half-planks for the same reason, but I can see and feel the improvements in my mind and body after such a long break from yoga. What I started noticing yesterday as well, and that continues, is that I breathe much more deeply on and off the mat. That was definitely needed!

"Loving this practice.  Trying not to get frustrated with my hips in sukhasana. Ive been practicing with YWA since March and my left hip still feels a small amount of discomfort, not pain.  Sometimes, I&#39;m ending up putting my let&#39;s out wide if we are sitting in the easy pose for any amount of time.  Any suggestions on what I can do to help this.  I do have a desk job and am wondering if my hips are saying, &#39;Wait a minute, what&#39;s going on here?&#39;. Lol!",April Ball,2021-01-03T11:24:10Z,0

"The past two months have been my longest break from yoga in two years, then the last week was extremely difficult because my cptsd somehow got triggered and I had a major breakdown followed by nightmares every single night. I feel so lost and broken, but I am trying to believe that I deserve to be found. This is what this year&#39;s journey means to me, a leap of faith. It is hard to have faith in myself and it is hard to show up because I feel rusted. But it helps so much to know that I am not alone in this. If I wouldn&#39;t have felt the support of this global community of amazing people, I couldn&#39;t find the motivation to get back on the mat. <br /><br />   So I just wanted to thank everyone here and share my love 💙 And thanks to you Adriene for making this possible, for your kind guidance, and for your inspiring grace 🙏",Zümra Dilşah Öksüz,2021-01-03T09:43:10Z,49

"Namaste, All ... From Dublin Ireland 🇮🇪<br /><br />5000 people practised at the same time as me 🤗<br /><br />While holding that plank pose, I really noticed how much strength I have developed since 2020&#39;s 30-Day journey! I used to curse Adrienne (apologies, Adrienne 😬🙈) or any teacher that talked while keeping us in a pose or meditation... Now having that strength allows me to focus on my breath solely.<br /><br />Today, I also appreciated the lesson of seeing each inhale as an arrival... What is the length of a breath? Is it a breath? Or is that what we call a &#39;moment&#39;? 💚",Andrew McLoughlin,2021-01-03T09:05:46Z,1
"I was also everytime in the run of last year annoyed and pissed off (also: sorry Adriene...!) by all that talking and that made me break up the practices sometimes because it made it impossible to concentrate. I do still not like all that talking and think it is just too much and leaves little time to focus and to go inside ourselves...but as you say, I have also experienced meanwhile that I can stay with myself inspite of that and become calmer and less annoyed 😉🙌 Lots of love to Dublin from Germany 🤗💫 feel connected 👍😊👍",Essay,2021-01-03T10:47:21Z,1

"Thank You Adriene! I am just coming back to Your channel after quite a while. Remembering when I first found it through a 30 Days challenge about 4 years ago. Being in a very ungrounded and lost state back then this practice has been such an anchor for me and feeling in which peaceful state I am now, how I am able to really drop deeper and deeper, just fills me with Love and Gratitude. Witnessing that healing is truly possible is a blessing. Just wanting to encourage everyone to keep going. May all of You be happy, healthy and peaceful!",Diggy Tal,2021-01-03T08:41:35Z,1

"The Guest House - Rumi <br /><br />This being human is a guest house.<br />Every morning a new arrival.<br /><br />A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br />some momentary awareness comes<br />as an unexpected visitor.<br /><br />Welcome and entertain them all!<br />Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,<br />who violently sweep your house<br />empty of its furniture,<br />still, treat each guest honourably.<br />He may be clearing you out<br />for some new delight.<br /><br />The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br />meet them at the door laughing,<br />and invite them in.<br /><br />Be grateful for whoever comes,<br />because each has been sent<br />as a guide from beyond.",Bréanainn Ó Mathúna,2021-01-03T08:39:27Z,1

Going to sound odd. But that the beginning of both day 1 and today&#39;s yoga session I started crying. Not like upset crying or subbing but tears just started forming and a couple ran down my cheeks while quietly focusing on my breath. It felt like my body was releasing the tension of the last year.

"2020 has been my year of hell. After more than 7 years of struggling in my studies and work, I decided to listen to my body and STOP. What followed was of course a breakdown of my body and I was diagnosed with severe, pent up, burnout. I have lain in bed for weeks. Then the pandemic happened. During those weeks in bed thinking, a lot of unresolved childhood trauma caused by skipping grades in school came up. Then, last december, in the space of just 10 days, my grandma died, my dog died and my father, not yet 60 years old, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I spent NYE sobbing my heart out. What was supposed to be my year of healing dug my even more into the mud. <br /><br />My former strong and fit body has been reduced to a quivering mess with VERY tight muscles and more than once I had to stop today because it was too hard or because relaxing caused me to sob again. But I am determined to make it through, however many breaks and modifications it might take. Showing up, every day, to do something for myself in these mountains of grief. Healing in 2021 is my goal.

"Breath day 2! Day 91 of my return to YWA. This was a bit of a workout. Not sure how Adriene is able to turn her ear to the mat in a twist. Mine is never anywhere near the ground. Perhaps one day.<br /><br />Remember everyone: &quot;Take your breaks when you need to.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;With each inhale, we mark a new arrival. Give your thinking mind a break and use that inhale as an opportunity to enter the present moment. Just one present moment after the other.&quot;",William B,2021-01-03T07:21:47Z,0

"This was a tough one if you&#39;re not in full health or have injuries. So remember yoga is for health. It&#39;s not an exercise or competition.  Poses are shown with variation and props.  So I do mountain pose instead of plank. With downward dog I use my bed, to put the arms on. If this is hard, use a table. For lunges,  you can either have the stretched leg on the floor. You can also do warrior one. With changes I could do the whole program today too. Now I have breakfast and then I rest. Take care and have lovely sunday.",Lotta Larsson,2021-01-03T06:47:20Z,1716

"Showing up for practice with YWA has helped me tremendously in being mindful about my actions, words and thoughts. One of the many things I noticed about myself is how I am better able to control my food cravings and opt for healthier options in my diet! Thank you for these sessions! 😊❤️",Gigi Reddit,2021-01-03T06:47:17Z,0
"Adriene, I&#39;ve noticed that you are much more still in this journey. I started doing your early yoga videos, and you were always moving around and I always felt a bit uneasy, since for me yoga is about stillness and connecting the practice with the breath. I enjoy it so much more now! I am just curious what changed, what made you decide to embrace stillness?",Georgian Tanase,2021-01-03T06:47:08Z,1
