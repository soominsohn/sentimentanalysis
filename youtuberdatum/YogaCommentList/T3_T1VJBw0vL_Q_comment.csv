I&#39;m determined to show up every morning before everything except making the coffee.  :)  I was getting a little frustrated at one point because I felt like we should be doing more!  And then I started to get it:  the breath.  That has to be a thing first.  I&#39;m beginning to see this practice seep into my days.  Awareness of breath, of my body&#39;s feelings, the need to get in some more stretches with balance in mind.  Thank you for this program.

I&#39;ve been surfing a lot lately and once I got on the mat I realized how sore and tight I was from it and it was a good time to renew a bit.

"Adriene and Find What Feels Good Community, <br />I graduated just last week and I still don&#39;t know what job title I should be searching for. I found myself discouraged as I looked and tried to convince myself I might be qualified for this job, or maybe that career....I felt like a mismatched puzzle piece with forced qualities. But when you asked why did we start this practice, the answer popped into my brain. I want to pursue yoga everyday. There is no force involved. Now I can write to them about my best qualities  and why I am here. Let them know I have all this beautiful curious scientific brain and I want to work in the field of science and healthcare. HERE I AM READY AND WILLING TO SPECIALIZE! Thank you for helping me write an honest cover letter that speaks to my better qualities. Openness and the curiosity to be better.

Good morning Adriene + Benji. I’m very new to Yoga and decided to commit to this 30 day journey. I have to say I’m doing fairly well for a beginner. 👍🏻I appreciate your work and of course love Benji🐾 Today’s practice seemed a little fast paced for me and had to rewind to get some poses in. I’m hopeful that with more practice I will flow with ease from pose to pose. I throughly enjoy spending my mornings practicing with you and Benji.<br />Thank you for your commitment 🙏🏻,Cheryl Forino,2021-03-18T13:49:30Z,0

"I am still making my way through this series.  I&#39;ve never been good at sticking with a daily commitment to myself.  I&#39;ll excitedly start something and then change my mind about it.  Or.. I won&#39;t be able to follow through for some reason.  But this is where I am, and I&#39;m working with it.  I decided that no matter how long it takes me, I will finish this 30 days.  It&#39;s so much better than giving up and starting some other new thing that I inevitably won&#39;t finish either.  Here I am.  In the muck with myself.  On my actual journey.  Not an ideal one.

"Went for a walk today and thought &quot;Geeze, I really feel like I&#39;m on a hamster wheel&quot;...and I MAY have said this out loud because...I was alone and in nature haha. And I graduated college in 2020 and have finally found a job, but it&#39;s not really what I want to do full-time, I think. It&#39;s crazy when you realize what the working world is--how many hours of life people dedicate to their jobs. I&#39;ve worked summer jobs before, and worked part-time in college but I don&#39;t know...it all seems so strange after so many years of school. <br /><br />Anyway, after doing this practice today I read the description, and when you mentioned the hamster wheel bit, I had to smile to myself. Sometimes it is so hard make time for yoga, or to motivate to do this practice when I&#39;ve missed a few days. But I do feel SO much better when I can commit and make the time. And I really am searching for ways to create meaning and comfort in my life. After finding Yoga With Adriene last March, right when the pandemic hit, I do feel like I have changed my thinking and experience surrounding my body. I notice more how I&#39;m moving, transitions between plank and downward dog feel more natural, and whenever there are days where I don&#39;t do yoga (Shhh!) I can actually feel my body missing it--can feel the need to stretch and move.<br /><br />So thanks lovely Adriene! We do so appreciate you. &lt;3",musicsummer12,2021-03-04T03:02:42Z,1

Well yesterday i was on the day for Renew. Day 22? Anyway, i cried through the whole 20 minutes. I had a lot of pent up emotion from the pervious days and i was already about to burst. When i sat down on the mat and we started to breath I felt everything rushing out of me. And it wouldnt stop. And I wouldnt stop. I kept going and cried through each pose. It was exactly what my heart needed. My point was im glad I hit day 22 on what was really like day 40. 🙈❤ love and light Adriene",Chyanne Foresman,2021-02-20T18:50:35Z,0

This was a beautiful practice and I was soaking in the simple wisdom of &quot;if it doesn&#39;t feel good don&#39;t do it&quot; and then Adriene says &quot;YWA is like pg-13.

"This daily practice for me, was all about finding power within myself over my body and my emotions. I sought to find peace in the craziness of life. I have been able to find such wonderfulness, but it took more effort on my part than I expected. I have now found that it is about learning to listen with love. As I learn to lovingly listen to what my body needs and have the strength and care to make those little (or even big) adjustments for myself, I have found a greater capacity to listen with love to those around me. I also watched the first Star Wars movie in the original trilogy for the first time ever (I had not seen any of them!) and I have totally found The Force Within Me because of this daily practice. Awesome haha!",Valaya Hart,2021-02-06T17:11:13Z,2
"I love this class. Just one thing, maybe to do it next time, on the last active pose, when we turn to the left, before we &quot;thread&quot; the arm, we put our right leg in &quot;frog&quot; position and breath deep for a couple of breaths, but we didn&#39;t do the same  with the left leg.",Viviane Van Giesen,2021-02-06T13:59:46Z,0

"Day 22: It is <i>incredible</i> how much better everything goes when I have actual traction between my feet and the floor.<br /><br />Yoga, in general, works so much better when it&#39;s not a fight.  And so often it is a fight: fighting my own tiredness and executive function to get to the mat in the first place, fighting my own brain to focus and not get too frustrated when there&#39;s something I can&#39;t do right away, fighting my own body to try and get it to move right.  Fighting my feet and my balance and my pose and my slippery living room rug to stay upright in Warrior or Star Pose.  And I <i>can</i> fight, and I can even win sometimes, and I gain something when I do, strength and stubbornness and workout, but--god, how much better it all is when it&#39;s not a fight at all.<br /><br />I think, more than anything, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been discovering this journey.  &#39;Renew&#39; is a good theme for today, when I&#39;m remembering my intention from day one, which was never to be very very good at this, but only to keep coming back and keep trying.  I think I thought, on January 1st, that that meant trying harder the next day when I&#39;d lost the fight, as I inevitably sometimes would.  I think now maybe it means learning to back down, back away, pause and come back and renew when I find the direction things don&#39;t have to be a fight from to begin with.<br /><br />It means previewing the videos so I know what poses I&#39;m in for and don&#39;t have to struggle to figure them out mid-practice.  It means rolling the rug back or buying a yoga mat so my feet actually stick to the floor instead of trying to stay upright purely with thigh strength and determination.  It means jumping on the moment in the middle of the morning when my body <i>wants</i> to get up and move, rather than forcing it.  Some days it means no yoga at all, and some days it means coming back and being more proud and satisfied with that than guilty.<br /><br />Eight more days to this sequence.  Maybe I&#39;ll go back and try &#39;Home&#39; again when this is done.  Maybe I&#39;ll move on to something else.  I&#39;ll keep going.",Clarity C,2021-02-04T16:53:57Z,2

I&#39;ve been going through a complicated situation, and my mind has been nothing but racing thoughts and lately i&#39;ve just been feeling anger too. I&#39;ve been trying to go through the work, but this one has been a tough one since it feels likes its just building up inside of me that i actually paused the video for a bit. Today i just wasn&#39;t feeling it even though i showed up. I hope tomorrow is a better day for me. Oh and i came here because i want to be and feel better for myself.

"I started the month off so well, then about a week and a half ago I started to lose focus and fell into a really negative place. This grey Canadian winter, especially with this current lockdown, has taken a massive toll on me physically and emotionally. I missed a few days of yoga and screwed up my month of clean eating and just spiralled. Every couple days I would try for the motivation to show up on the mat and catch up on the missed videos, some days I would do two or three videos back to back but never seemed to catch up. Today I found myself 5 days behind on this challenge. I am struggling to be better than my negative thoughts. I have a test tomorrow that I barely had the concentration to study for today. But I just completed day 22, so I&#39;m going to be grateful for that small win and remind myself that in 10hrs I will wake up to a new day and can try again. Day 23 is the new Day 27, right?!",alisondawnsmith,2021-01-28T00:15:13Z,1
"Definitely! It&#39;s okay to not be okay. Keep showing up, girl. You can do it. I &quot;fell behind&quot; due to a muscle injury and I thought about doing multiple videos a day to &quot;catch up&quot;, but I decided to keep doing it one day at a time to really enjoy it and not stress out, since the intention for me is to enjoy this journey. In the end it doesn&#39;t really matter, if we are a couple of days behind, does it? The most important thing is to show up and do something for yourself.",Alex Lemke,2021-01-28T21:15:07Z,1
I&#39;m running a couple of days behind on this yoga journey because life is just freaking HARD right now- but I think it was meant to be because that yoga session was EXACTLY what my body was craving tonight. Pure magic!,liz Beatty-Owens,2021-01-27T23:38:09Z,0

Catching up after a few days rest. Kids be acting crazy with the full moon. Some self renewal was so needed today. The bind in the twist was exactly what felt good for me and my piriformis muscles today. ❤,BackpackerRose,2021-01-27T22:58:19Z,0

"Once again I see I move from the routine my parents did ❤️. Standing up arms wide and bending over to cross and touch the opposite foot with the hand.

"Today was my favorite so far. I did day 21 and 22 in my robe, with my kids nearby taking classes, totally not the &quot;zen&quot; space, but I was able to follow the flow.

"I have not been feeling well the past couple of days, and had to take it easy. I am a little behind with my practices, and those I manage to finish feel more difficult, or at least some of them do.

I went to bed last night with a really cluttered pre pms brain that started making me doubt my life choices and it became so overwhelming. I slept just fine but I woke up feeling really heavy and didn&#39;t have the urge to go on my mat. Something convinced me to just do a shorter practice today to accomplish my morning routine in full and I was able to unwind and breathe fuller throughout and I feel a bit better now. I think I was pulled in so I wouldn&#39;t give into my head thoughts that aren&#39;t real for the remainder of the day. so thank you for these positive comments in this thread and it sure as heck helped me this morning.,Nora Shvartsberg,2021-01-26T13:41:12Z,0

When reading the next three practices were a &#39;trifecta&#39; I had to come back and makeup this session.  Im SO glad did!<br /><br />Doing this particular practice make me realize how far I have come on my strength and my relationship with  my breath.  It&#39;s SO exciting and empowering!  <br /><br />I&#39;m moving so much more fluid and holding positions for much longer.  I can breath deeply during twists and I  feel much more in control.  I didn&#39;t even have to move my covid belly out of the way like I did in the beginning.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite practices.

"I really enjoyed this practice, and I have loved BREATH so far. I have now joined in several of the YWA January 30 Days of Yoga, and with each one, I feel my own growth and a greater connection to everything! I am so grateful to Adriene, Benji, and all of the team for the hard work and love they put into these programmes, and into all that they do! You are a bright light in these dark days, and truly always. 🧘🏾‍♀️💗⭐💫",Kate Forman,2021-01-24T00:24:33Z,0
"Today was the first day I had to drag myself to the mat, but I am so glad I did. It&#39;s funny because I always feel so much better after yoga, but despite that I had a lazy part of me that wanted to skip it today cause I already did a hard boxing workout. Then I looked at my calendar with all the stickers for doing each day. Why stop now? Why ever stop? If it helps calm my mind, find inner peace and make my body feel rejuvenated, there are no cons! Just a reminder to fight the lazy side of you that comes out once in awhile. It&#39;s worth it to give yourself time and space. You deserve to treat your body with care. Thanks as always Adriene.

These practices are so good and they are a real treat for me. Don’t want to be a spoil sport but how is it an accomplishment to do a nice short and sweet yoga session everyday for 30 days? Makes me wonder how y’all deal with the real challenges in life... ?,Ann Bangert,2021-01-23T23:24:51Z,0
“Real challenges” are the easy ones - they’re the ones we can’t ignore or refuse to engage with. But committing to self care is optional - it’s a choice that we have to re-commit to daily. And that’s what’s hard.,Amy M Simoneau,2021-01-24T00:17:54Z,1
"I hope you don&#39;t mind if I share my perspective on this one. I think it&#39;s because of the &quot;real challenges&quot; in life that committing to something like this is a big accomplishment for many people, including me. The world is full of work, sickness, commitments to other people, stressors good and bad. Honestly, this is the first time I have stuck with something like this on a daily basis even though I intellectually understood in the past that it wasn&#39;t a massive time commitment. It&#39;s great that it feels easy for you--and now that I&#39;m in the habit it feels easier for me than it used to--but I wouldn&#39;t use people&#39;s ability to commit to yoga practice as a gauge for how they handle their problems.",Kathleen Jones,2021-01-23T23:45:47Z,0

"I love the idea of renewing...and I love when Adriene said we may not have realized the real reason we started this journey. I started this journey to get back into some sort of exercise - or so I thought. It turns out my mind really knew that I needed this journey to build a better relationship with myself, my center, my mental healing, and my physical healing. It’s turned into so much more than just a “30 day challenge” as I initially thought. It’s become a journey that I have needed for so long.",Claire Mahaffy,2021-01-23T22:59:32Z,0

Not only physically, but mentally too. Change for the better. Change the idea of self-love for me. Change the perspective i was seeing things with.

So I just rolled out of bed and, still in my pajamas, made myself practice (it took a bit of self-convincing). I’m so glad I did though. Already I find my energy a bit boosted, and I’ve crossed something off my to-do list, which I wasn’t expecting to be able to do. Once again, thank you Adriene ❣️",KitKat,2021-01-23T20:37:06Z,1

But I got on the mat anyway and found a place to reconnect to myself and recognize the few things that I have control of- my breath, the way I treat myself and my loved ones, and my acceptance of the things outside of my control. While renewal didn&#39;t connect with my family&#39;s situation, it did connect with how I can approach the world and address my emotions. Thank you for reminding me that hard times aren&#39;t forever and there is still purpose to trying to be a functional human being. A little glimmer of hope is so important right now, not just for me. Hope everyone else had a reflective and supportive practice as well. &lt;3",Avi,2021-01-23T18:30:47Z,0

"Today was a modified more than most kind of class from taking this class after a sweaty bike ride but what I loved about today was the mindful meditation at the beginning. Even though I needed to kneel for it to feel more stability (legs and feet like in extended child&#39;s pose), it helped ground my uneasy breath and helped move me through the rest of the class. Thank you for your love and messaging today and every day!",Dani Wenger,2021-01-23T18:10:15Z,0

Ought I to try for one or the other; if so, knee or shoulder? There&#39;s no pain, just lack of flexibility. :) Thanks so much Adriene. I&#39;ve been practicing &quot;with you&quot; (not quite) daily for nearly a year now. I am WAY more flexible now at 57, than I was when I began at 56 and so very grateful for all that you continue to teach me. I live in a place surrounded by the ocean and as a former (childhood-young adult asthmatic), I am embracing the breathing techniques I have learned from you, with great joy.

With that said, I must have really enjoyed yesterday and today, as I barely remember what we did! However it must have stuck; I noticed how I was planting my feet when walking; how I bent to pick up the dogs dish; how deliberate and intentional my movement were.  Weird.

"Love the thought that there is a thread of renewal guiding us through this practice and the next two. I imagine it threads through the Uni verse and comes humming back through Adriene as she downloads her sessions and adds a poem and a tune.  The why becomes clearer with each day of BREATH and each moment remembering to be awake to that wave of connectedness.<br />Love waving out to the ocean of yogis calming the seas.  Thank you, thank you, ONE and ALL",Anne Roe,2021-01-23T16:08:46Z,0

This is exactly what I needed. I was having some anxiety last night and this renewal practice today was beautiful! I felt powerful doing the one legged dog hip stack pose. I never new I could feel that way doing a pose like that! My physical and inner strength has grown beyond what I thought was possible during these 22 days. It&#39;s crazy how no matter what you&#39;re struggling with there is always something each of us can find as an answer or as peace on the mat. Even though the practice is the same it is not the same outcome for each person participating. Its a beautiful idea that everyone can come and do the same thing but come out with different renewals.

"Today was my favourite practice so far. So many things fell into place. I’ve been doing YWA for two years now,, Yoga on and off before that for  a few years but today when Adriene said ‘Maybe you just stand there saying - Everything is so integrated, I got this’ that was exactly how I felt. After all those years everything DID feel integrated. There were a few poses in this practice that were impossible or very difficult when I started like stacking the hips in down dog or humble warrior or grabbing my foot during the twist and now they come easy and my movements have a bit of fluidity to them. So to everyone out there struggling thinking ‘I will never get this’ you will in time. <br />And a big thanks to Adriene for gifting me with the poems of Mary Oliver. I had never heard of her before they appeared at the end of some emails and I love them. It’s the first time poetry connected with me. I was quite surprised. Love and light to everyone🌞🌞",Roxane Neumann,2021-01-23T12:44:09Z,0

"I’d say YWA is a PG. If I had kids I’d want to keep an eye on them to make sure they didn’t perform asanas in a potentially dangerous way. I also think it’d be a good shared experience and opportunity to talk over how they felt as a result of the practice.   Sure, there’s a lot innuendos and double entendres, but that’d probably sail over there heads.",Ally Hoff,2021-01-23T12:37:00Z,0
"Why am I here? Because I know it&#39;s the best for me, because it gives me life and because I love you Adriene! You have certainly changed my life for good. Interesting class today, I really enjoyed it. See you tomorrow on the mat! Day 22 in!!",Gabriela F,2021-01-23T12:35:36Z,2

I was a bit scatterbrained and distracted for part of it, especially the first triangle and supine twist, confusing left and right, but I got it for the other side each time and it was much better :D I also managed to touch the floor with my fingertips on the second triangle pose, which is a great win! I&#39;ll have to try this practice again (I&#39;ll most probably start Breath all over again in February anyway), but it was already greatly beneficial and a lovely way to renew my commitment to this daily practice. I look forward to discovering the next two. See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-23T11:33:40Z,0
"Renew has many meanings. The core of the  saying &quot;each day is new day&quot; is hard to grasp and embody. <br />Today, dear Adriene, you showed how to physicaly feel what it means to renew, it doen&#39;t hav to be something we whisper quietly in our heart, it can be loud, bright and flamboyant .<br /> It all starts with little things , piling up one on top of the other. Each day is a new opportunity to renew something, we don&#39;t have to wait till we lose all passion .<br />Every single moment is an opportunity to start again, no need to wait until the end.<br />&quot;Thank you&quot; is the first thing runing through my brainn when I think of you! <br />From my heart to everybody&#39;s heart, have a wonderful day.

Thank you Adriene and your team.",bjhowes,2021-01-23T10:38:42Z,3
"Absolutely loving this 30 day Yoga course.  I have NEVER managed to stick with it to the end when I have attempted your courses before (guess being “locked down” helps?!). I am now beginning to understand why it’s a 30 day course.  It’s all CONNECTED.  I have had trouble sleeping and have tried everything - avoiding caffeine, alcohol, screens, etc, but I have usually been waking at 2am and restless until the early morning.  Then SUDDENLY after day 20, I am sleeping SO much more soundly.  The only thing I have changed is sticking to this daily course, and so I am going with that, and will definitely be looking to continue when this amazing experience ends in only another 8 days. Thank you so much for all your work, your patience and kindness to us all.",Heather Prophet,2021-01-23T10:34:42Z,1

"Lately I commented your videos a lot and I am not the commenting kind! Your videos make me feel so great that I cannot help showing my appreciation for what you do. But what makes me super happy is to read in the comments how good you make so many people feel and how so many have been “saved” by you, Benji and FWFG, your exercises and your words. To imagine so many people get off the mat feeling a tiny bit happier than when they got on the mat or generally in life, is simply overwhelming and magical. Cheesy, but...if we all could be a little bit of Adriene for others in our lives... this world would be so much better. Love you all. Namaste.",511Cloud,2021-01-23T10:14:48Z,78

"Good for you! It&#39;s noce easy. This practice is a moment to let yourself feel your feelings. All feelings are meant for feeling, not just the &#39;good&#39; ones. Even &#39;negative&#39; emotions have so much to teach us. <br />I personally find it helpful to think of yoga as a spiritual practice, and not a workout. :)",Stephanie R,2021-01-23T11:12:26Z,1

"Also in the UK, finding this third lockdown tough. Getting onto the mat daily is my little personal treat to myself, where the world outside disappears from my thoughts. After 18 years of doing a bit of yoga here and there, by myself, never in a class, this is the first time I have stuck with a daily practice and, maybe because if the circumstances, it feels just right. I am starting to finally “get it”. Though it will be a while before my body gets those twists right!

"To me this whole journey is about self-love and reconnecting with my true self. Even when Adriene gently guides her thigh into a deeper twist you can feel the love, for her own body, for herself; just as if she was caressing Benji :) And I noticed: I know I can be so loving with others, but when was the last time I focused that loving care towards myself? So many reminders along the journey - thank you Adriene!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",Ciara Gutierrez,2021-01-23T08:26:50Z,227
"I&#39;ve said this before, but yoga truly is magical in that the yoga of the day always fits my situation perfectly - &quot;renew&quot; was the perfect theme for me today specifically :) Also, I love, love, love that flow with the arms from the beginning. Always such a joy, thank you Adriene.",M Chagawa,2021-01-23T08:26:21Z,112

"Interestingly, the hardest part of today&#39;s practice was the transition from belly to back for the twists...lots of awkward squirming, but I got where I needed to be, haha. I love your shirt today - it was like a visualization of your reminders to bring energy up through the front body while grounding down through the back.",rachelrossos,2021-01-23T08:14:41Z,1

"Have been dealing with a lot of anxiety for the past 2 days and had a sleepless night and woke up this morning feeling panicked.

"I really loved today&#39;s practice theme! Because my exam is so close (next tuesday!) I need to remind myself why I started university, why I&#39;m getting this degree and why I have to keep pushing. The yoga practice with you is teaching me to take a breath and stay strong, phisically and mentally, and sometimes even to take a break too to reconnect with myself and my purpose. Also, it allows me to throw my attention, at least for half an hour, from the negative things that are happening in Italy because of this pandemic. Thank you so much for every kind word, every thought you share (I love when I can get some references, like the songs you quote haha now I need to listen to it to get it off my head haha). See you and all the beautiful souls around here tomorrow! Have a nice day/evening/night and be safe!",Alessia Trombini,2021-01-23T07:36:13Z,12

"Hello dear Adriene, I have a question and I would be so happy if you answered: I ordered a Tshirt from the &quot;Breath&quot;-Series right at the beginning of week two, and the day it should have arrived I got a refund-email because apparently the Tshirt was sold out - obviously I was not expecting this because when I ordered the Tshirt everything was fine! I would still really love to get this Tshirt -  Is there any Chance the Breath-products will get back in stock? <br />Can&#39;t wait to do today&#39;s practice!

Almost didn&#39;t get up early to do this before the kids were up (we have 4 little ones) and snoozed 4 times. But I&#39;m SO glad I did get the time to do this wonderful practise alone. I LOVED it!

Although, I follow Adriene every single minute, I spend 15 minutes stretching my neck and my upper back. I have severe problems with my neck and my migraines so before doing some asanas, it&#39;s important and vital for me to do a good warming up. I&#39;ll practice again this evening.

"My why is that I needed something to hold onto through January, which I knew would be a difficult time due to a lockdown with no clear end. I wanted a wholesome distraction. The yoga has given me that and more. The breathing exercises have led to real moments of peace (no mean feat!) and the positions and movements are wonderfully grounding. I&#39;ve come to treasure the daily practice.",Eleanor H,2021-01-23T19:37:51Z,2
"My why? Because I&#39;m learning to recognise how my mind, breath and body movements are connected.  As I get stronger, steadier more balanced, thinking about how I move makes me more aware, in control and confident.  The focus on breathing into the poses and out for release is helping me co-ordinate flow.  It feels really good!  Thank you, I enjoyed taking a moment for your invitation to pause, consider and reflect :) &lt;3",gipsi,2021-01-23T11:30:04Z,1

"So happy I’ve made it this far! I’ll be honest, I didn’t believe in myself. When I began doing yoga (three weeks ago) I felt horrible about my body and self. This journey has helped me a tremendous amount! And it’s only been three weeks! I’m sad it almost over but I’m going to go back and do more 30 day journeys. Adriene, you are a gift! Thank you so much!",꧁sweetli꧂,2021-01-23T06:21:36Z,3
