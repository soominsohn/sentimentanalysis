"It is the final day of the journey but in every end is a new beginning. <br />And we can always start with the breath. <br /><br />I always get emotional on Day 30 because I think this is such a truly special and remarkable, meaningful exchange.

Thank you Adriene for this amazing 30 day yoga journey .😁 I have done all your 30 day yoga journeys and love them all. You are my only yoga instructor I feel like you are me if I was a yoga instructor because I’m kinda goofy and random too lol and love my fur babies. You are the best. I will say though I am a frequent yogi I do yoga with you every day but I did not make it through the 30th day video simply because of the no instructions I really like the instructions so I don’t have to constantly look at the screen to see what you are doing. I may be good but I’m not that good lol it’s just bothersome to me to have to keep turning my head to look at the video to see what you are doing. 😜 maybe do it like your power yoga video where you talk over the quiet practice with like a soothing voice . I know I sound so dumb probably but it is what it is I am a listener and like to just close my eyes and have you lead me through my practice. That’s just me though. Anywho I love you and Benji to pieces I would love so much to see y’all at Bonnaroo they always have yoga practices there but I’ve never done them but if you were leading I definitely would go because I love you both so much. 😁 thank you for all you do ♥️,Brooke S,2021-04-30T17:25:01Z,0

"I think this has taken me about 5 or 6 weeks to complete as I haven’t practised every day. I started to do this final day on Friday but I hadn’t realised it was 50 minutes so didn’t have time before work, and I really missed Adriene’s guiding voice and actually felt quite annoyed by it! BUT I returned to it today feeling ready and now I’m so happy I did. I really enjoyed it and so proud I’ve finished! 😊",Leona Stevenson,2021-05-08T23:21:37Z,0

"I love your videos and have been doing yoga with you for 6 years. I have one constructive comment on this particular video. I find it extremely difficult to follow the flow with no commentary. I’m constantly having to look at the screen for the transition (when to come out of child’s pose, etc.) and find myself always losing balance as I crane my neck to see the screen. Could you provide a quiet, voice over commentary for each pose to help those of us who would like to do the flow without constantly looking at the screen? It would really help me stay in the moment of the flow.  Thanks for allowing me to comment!",Eileen Ikeda,2021-04-30T02:39:33Z,0

"I am a bit late to the party, but still wanted to write this comment.<br />This was the first time I committed to something longer than 2 weeks! And while yes, go me, good job, I have Adriene to thank for this journey&lt;3<br />For putting so much love, effort and compassion into each session.<br />I was watching them before I went to sleep everyday, so I couldn’t really comment on each episode, on all the moments she’d burst into songs, or walk “with an attitude”, or make funny jokes and then disregard them as if they weren’t funny:) I was cracking upxD <br />&amp; I really appreciated her being human:3<br />Especially the times, when right before I thought my hands can’t handle my weight anymore, she’d switch to another exercise❤️<br />I loved that it wasn’t about “pushing your limits”, but about showing up, being there for yourself and slowly building your strength🙌<br />I was bawling my eyes out during the last session, because I didn’t want this to end. And though yes, there  are lots of other videos, and it’s not really a goodbye, for a while there this felt like something real coming to an end:3  and to every “namaste” at the end I’d say “thank you Adriene”, and not hearing “namaste” on the last session broke my heart a little😅<br />I truly hope that this journey will mark the beginning of something great, because now I know that I cAn do something for myself every day. I just have to find the right thing and put less pressure on myself, because the hardest and the most important part is showing up;)",BenaziR,2021-04-28T00:18:05Z,0

"Hi Adriene. I had a great time doing yoga to the music. I had to look up quit frequently to see what you were doing. I was suprised at how confident I was in this yoga sequence despite having to stop at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwyEtS_7OQ&amp;t=42m14s"">42:14</a> due to being dizzy. But, I do commit to doing this whenever something emotionally disturbing arises. It is not known to me right now there was a block at  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwyEtS_7OQ&amp;t=42m14s"">42:14</a> but, I am learning to draw boundaries where my bodhi can learn.

"I have never finished one of these before, never even gotten to day 5. Now I did the whole thing. I showed up for myself every single day and I&#39;m so proud of myself. Through this I learned to appreciate, cherish rest. Every single short moment of rest in between plank positions or some other thing that was hard and difficult. I&#39;m going to treat rest with the appreciation it deserves - not just idle scrolling on the phone (though sometimes that is also needed!), but moments, glorious gulps of rest like refreshing water to parched mouth.",OhDeerGirl,2021-04-09T17:30:59Z,1

Turns out she was right and I was able to do it. In fact I was surprised at how much I had learned ove the course of this yoga journey - the way I instinctively knew where she might go next, the way I was naming the positions in my head as I went along, the way I was aware of my form and knew how to breathe through the movements. <br /><br />I had a very moody day yesterday, just an off day which led into a lack of energy and will this morning but after doing this I felt so energised, refreshed. I moved through this morning with ease.

Not just physically but it has help me mentally as well. I am struggling with depression and stress but doing this relieves everything and makes me feel alive.,CoolFromSchool,2021-04-04T03:32:25Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for transforming my relationship with yoga. And, to all the people around the world who were part of this journey, I am proud of each and every one of you. I know stepping into the mat and be present took a little while to do, but you were able to do it nonetheless.<br /><br />Thank you also, my dear self, for being gentle, encouraging, and strong. I will continue doing yoga, not for its grand poses, but for connecting with my breath and to be with myself.<br /><br />Kudos to Adriene and your team for planning and producing every episode down to the core. And what more is that everything is free. You, guys, are the best!<br /><br />(p.s. can i just say, I am slowly developing Adriene&#39;s nuances and sometimes I hear her speaking inside my head like &quot;Move where it feels good.&quot; Damn, you are a legend, woman!)<br /><br />Namaste. ✨",DANIZE MARIE LUKBAN,2021-04-02T03:29:40Z,0

"I cried as well like so many of you here. I just finished it a second ago and it also took me around two months to get to every exercise.

"Wow, wow, wow! I did it! Total noobie to yoga. Day 1, my upper back muscles were so weak and tight that it hurt to do the sitting pose in prayer. My wrists hurt so bad they were on fire and I thought I can&#39;t do this, my body is too broken (cos of lockdown) Day 30 and my upper back feels stronger and my wrists don&#39;t hurt. I feel lighter, stronger, but what&#39;s incredible is how I feel about doing daily yoga. It&#39;s empowering and rewarding. I learnt discipline in BJJ but lockdown stole it from me. Yoga, this challenge, reminds me of what I&#39;m capable of and to never let them get me down. To keep fighting and to keep moving, no matter what (depression). Thanks Adriene. Perfect intro to my Yoga journey. I WILL do daily Yoga in the AM. I plan to book privates to master basic fundamentals of Yoga as I do not want to injure my back and knees. Until then, I can do the basic poses I&#39;m capable of and will, and i promise myself this, I will be able to stand on one leg (flat feet) by end of the year :D :D :D Congrats to anyone who managed to do the challenge! We&#39;ve got this. Edit: I feel overwhelmed suddenly :)",Belle Princess,2021-04-01T11:15:58Z,0

"ADRIENE, GUYS, EVERYONE, I DID IT!!! When I started this practice (March 1st), for some reason I decided to really commit to doing it every day this time, even though I can hardly ever be that dedicated and consistent with anything. But I did it, 30 days of yoga in a row without missing a single day!!! I&#39;ve been showing up even if when it was hard, even when I felt exhausted both emotionally and physically, I even created a personal encouragement for such days — &quot;Just roll the mat out and start the video, don&#39;t think about what&#39;s next&quot;. It was always worth it, every single time.  And this last practice... It went so much better that the previous 30th day! I really did create my own practice, only peeking at the video now and then for more ideas or just to look at our beautiful mentor. I truly felt like I was meditating in motion, not just exercising. Thank you a million times, Adriene, for helping me transform and improve. Also, now I want to continue doing yoga more regulary — if not daily, then at least a few times each week. I love you. Namaste.",Diana,2021-03-31T20:29:59Z,5

"At first I didn’t want to get sweaty at all. Meaning no movement that requires too much strength. But then in the middle I found myself wanting to push through and before I knew it, my sweat was dripping all over my carpet. Really nice though, and the practice didn’t feel long at all. Hopefully... no... I WANT to stick with the routine, I want to make it part of my life. And finished just the right time to follow the next calendar!",Ariix,2021-03-31T15:26:03Z,2

"I get that you want to express your frustration, but no need to offend people without any reason. I liked it because it was the opportunity for us to practice whatever we needed to, since everyone is different and throughout this journey each of us had their own &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; poses that they noted. I didn&#39;t lie down doing nothing, I spent the time working on the poses that are hard for me.",Diana,2021-03-31T20:40:20Z,0

"Why don&#39;t you pre-watch a section, memorize a little, pause the video, do the thing and go on like that?<br /><br />Or was your comment meant as a joke?

"This was an incredible way to end this journey! I meant to do it with everyone else, and then got COVID right after the New Year. Since then, I&#39;ve been taking it slow - but my hope was to get to day 30 by the end of March, and here we are.

"I love yoga with Adriene, and I&#39;ve loved this series, but it was my first 30 day series and I found this last practice to be very difficult and not satisfying. I understand the idea behind trusting yourself and your breath, but I had a hard time feeling like I could focus on my practice because I kept trying to look at the screen to see what you were doing. It would have been great if you could have voiced over and cued for the changes in positions or something along those lines.

"I started doing some of your classes at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 just for stretching really,as I was so much at home and not moving enough I was really stiffed. 2021 I started this journey and it was a whkle new discovery. It wasn&#39;t a stretching practice anymore , it began to be spiritual too. Meditative. I started reading more about yoga practice and the meaningful way of living and on the mat with you I was exactly where I needed to be.

"Finally completed the last day. I have a habit of stopping something abruptly as I realize the end is approaching. Sometimes it’s because I don’t want things to end/change and other times it’s because I believe the final step is too difficult for me to accomplish. I’ve been doing this challenge consistently for a month, but then it took me two weeks to finally get to the last one. I had reasons like school work and exhaustion, but that never stopped me from finding a time for the previous 29 days.  However long it took me , I did it!! feel so capable now to set more yoga/exercise goals for myself in the future.",Carmen Cordero,2021-03-28T23:54:58Z,0
"I  do yoga regularly with this channel, but I pick and choose videos. Have started many 30-day practices in order, but never finished them. This was the first one. I was very disappointed and somewhat baffled at the notion that no narration could become a tradition. I couldn&#39;t close my eyes to focus inward, had to contort out of every forward fall, every downward facing dog, every child&#39;s pose, so I could see if we were out of it and what was coming next. Though it&#39;s true that the body got a workout, the mind got no meditation and no inward focus practice.",Laura Virella,2021-03-28T19:37:38Z,0

"I completed day  30 today. I was completely overwhelmed in the best way. I felt like we had been practising sequences of a dance for 29 days and today we danced the whole song. I did not expect this. I was surprised at how emotional this made me, in a good way. I heard Adrien’s voice in my head and what she had taught me over the last 29 days even though I could not hear her. I felt connected. I have been trying out yoga for the last year, jumping from one session to another, never finding what I was looking for. I have learnt more in the last 30 days than in the last year.  I look forward to continuing this journey now I have found my guide. I would love some one on one time with this lady. Thank you so much Adriene. I’ll see you on the mat.

"Adriene, thank you so much for the past thirty days. I honestly cried twice during this last session: once when I looked at the screen and saw we were in the same position, and once when I looked and you turned and smiled at the camera. Thank you for bringing this into the world, for helping so many, and for helping me realise yoga is something I can do. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",SamJPatterson,2021-03-24T18:21:21Z,1
"This beautiful and growth-inducing experience, and making it to the 30 days with our dear Adriene, has brought enormous pride in myself and a sense of CENTER I&#39;ve not quite felt before. Of course I got teary a few times on this last day, like many others here. Tears of grief because this particular experience has ended, tears of joy for having made it through, and tears of thanks and gratitude for how much this has touched my life. Thank you, Adriene. And now we begin! Namaste, y&#39;all. Namaste.",Tasha Mehne,2021-03-24T13:19:22Z,0
"Adriene, I&#39;d like to thank you! I have tried in other moments to practice with you through the 30 days yoga journey, but now is the very first time that I can do it till the end.

I just wanted to say this last session was difficult because I never knew when the movements changed, I am only looking at it from an iPad screen and kept having to take peeks. I was either too slow or too fast. Maybe you could put some kind of peep or sound that warns us that your changing position? Cheers and thanks again for such great videos.",Jenelle Astner,2021-03-22T10:34:36Z,0
It has taken me till today to complete this journey.. though it has taken me much longer than I anticipated I am happy that I finally finished something that I set a focus for.. it&#39;s been tough as I&#39;m one of those that truly demands too much from herself. <br />I did it and you will too.

"Thank you, Adriene for guiding us through this wonderful journey.<br />At first when I began the challenge, I felt a lot of resentment, I felt uneasy, I couldn&#39;t enjoy the practises and be present. It took me a while to accept all the practises as they are. And myself as well. But at the end of the final week, I finally gave in and did not force anything. <br />I have been doing yoga for about three years now and I started from your videos. It has been life changing, I must say. And every day when I come to practise, I learn something new.<br />Thank you again for guiding us with so much love.

"Wow! Out of all my years doing your challenges, this is the first time that I&#39;ve done all 30 days in a row! Each day I felt a new emotion: strength, courage, depression, anxiety, hope, peace, etc. Each day I didn&#39;t know what emotion that I would bring to the mat...but I made a daily promise to myself to make it there. I also have begun to notice how I carry myself/process things differently when I&#39;m off of the mat. I have incorporated the benefits of our practices (especially focusing on the breath and building a loving relationship with myself) into my everyday life. To be honest, today I was a bit nervous since you wouldn&#39;t be guiding us but to my surprise, I flowed through this practice with such ease. Thank you, Adriene, for gifting me a toolbox that I will always have in my arsenal. You are a true gem.

Every morning when i do yoga...it gives me energy to fight for day and most of all THE ENERGY that is transferred from Andriene to me...full of postivity...My favourite part is to hug my knees...makes me to love and pamper myself....Thankyou Andriene... Will be regular for your sessions!!!,Sejal Dhanta,2021-03-16T13:03:46Z,0
Did anyone just do their own thing on day 30 and not look at Adrienne at all? It was so fun to just do what feels good and incorporate everything Adrienne has taught us and take extra time on our favorites. Love this idea of a quite practice for the last day.,Mora Ceramics,2021-03-16T12:19:21Z,46
"@Pat Bone I started the Yoga Camp from 5 years ago and I love it! It feels right, going through the basics. I&#39;ve done yoga on and off (mostly off) for many years, but still feel like a beginner. Maybe because I never practised consistently. Now I&#39;m on the 37th day of practise in a row, and it feels so different from going to a studio once a week. I feel my body getting stronger and more flexible every day.",Sara Dixon,2021-04-22T08:44:32Z,0
"@Sara Dixon I felt the very same way! I also did Day #30 again today &amp; I still followed her, maybe by this time next year i can do the last day on my own, but even if i still find myself looking at her, am still going to be good with that....after all she is THE Yoga Instructor🤗😉Tomorrow I plan to start over the  30-day challenge or start a new one if she has any. I also plan that during the 30 - days, I will be doing some of her other videos",Pat Bone,2021-04-15T19:49:06Z,0
"@Pat Bone I also felt that I needed to follow Adriene. At first I got stressed for not finding my way on my own, but then I thought &quot;That&#39;s entirely up to me!&quot; and decided that following Adriene was where I was today. Maybe after another 30 day journey I will feel ready to go on my own.",Sara Dixon,2021-04-15T10:19:20Z,3
"@Mora Ceramics  It was bit challenging for me not get directions, but maybe you are correct &quot;doing their own thing and not looking at Adriene&quot; maybe that&#39;s what she wanted us to do, but a full 51 mins of Yoga is a bit much....in my opinion!! I can see no directions for 15 - 20 mins, but.....Even though I felt that way it still wasa GREAT class, and I am going to repeat Day #30 tomorrow as well, and start again the following day! Blessings to Adriene for giving us 30 phenomenal days, so appreciate her &amp; the class as well!!!! Namaste!!!",Pat Bone,2021-04-14T17:12:35Z,2

"Hello Adriene.  Today I completed my first 30 day series with you.  Today&#39;s final practice was lovely, yet I too also would love a version with some basic verbal cues (or even a ting/bell during some of the floor movements, such as child&#39;s pose, to cue so we don&#39;t keep trying to look at the screen).   Because I don&#39;t wear my glasses during practice my vision limits looking at the screen and an auditory cue would be helpful.  Finally, I would like to start another 30 day series.  I notice you have several from the past but was wondering if you, or others, might suggest which series would be a good follow-up to this one.  Thanks.",Mary S.,2021-03-14T19:05:33Z,0

Thank you for this wonderful journey. However I feel as though Day 30 undid the benefits of the previous 29. I could not relax and enjoy it because I was constantly watching to see the next move. At no point could I close my eyes and concentrate on my breathing. A sound maybe to let us know of a change of pose would be good. My neck is now sore from trying to see the screen to see what you were doing.  Apart from that it has been a beautiful experience.,Claire Matthews,2021-03-14T10:27:50Z,0

My cat practices with me, and likes to watch the dog she feels she is far more dedicated to yoga...  Unfortunately I quit twenty minuets into day 30. Sigh, Craning my neck, trying so see what was going on without voice prompts so a thirty day fail for me. Adriene&#39;s practice on day 30 is beautiful, but if I was just going to watch a yoga video, I could have done that 30 days ago.",Elizabeth Ferrall,2021-03-13T15:38:09Z,0

"I found this journey 11 days late but I started it anyhow and finished today!!  And like others who noted, it was emotional and I was proud of myself to commit each day.  Adriene, you make it easy to look forward to each lesson and I really enjoyed the email letters that came with each days practice and quote at the end.  Sadly, at 59, I wish I had tried yoga sooner.  Always thought it would be too slow and boring as my fitness has always been running, blading, cycling and hiking, etc.  Anything that brings me outdoors.  But the years of strenuous fitness activities have taken a toll on me physically.  Your class helped me so much.  Helped me to slow down and be kind to my body.  Learning the tools of breathing and stretching and posture, have spilled into other parts of my life and have brought calmness.  Your sense of humor cracks me up and having Benji there is so sweet.  I have a cattle dog of my own who loves to be near me when I practice.  Anyways, thank you, thank you, thank you for providing this to the community.  It was fun knowing I was practicing with others even in my own home.  I can&#39;t wait till I can try a practice a studio when it&#39;s safe.  I hear it is amazing.

"I was so looking forward to the last day. I feel like it&#39;s been a long journey which definitely changed me. I&#39;ve started this series when my mental health was probably at my lowest point. Moved house, looked for a new job and I thought I needed a new BEGIN. I&#39;d have just waited for the mornings to jump on my mat. I was so motivated, It took me a while to finish just because of my work. I loved this flow but I must admit I am a bit disappointed because there is no voice to guide. It feels like it&#39;s something to watch rather then practise. I had to stop because I couldn&#39;t stand looking at the video ( which I normally don&#39;t do it) and trying and do the poses. I couldn&#39;t focus on my breath. I still love yoga and Adrienne&#39;s videos! Ready to start tomorrow a new one!",Silvia,2021-03-12T09:47:46Z,0

it was a beautiful series. i feel incredibly blessed to have access to such quality practice for free! anytime or anywhere i want. this is amazing! <br /><br />i did find this last session difficult to follow though. it was a bit too quick and forced me to constantly check the screen to follow the sequence. i lost that beautiful sense of presence and focus on my movement. the focus was outwards and made feel a bit rushy. i believe it would work best to keep the meditative flow but use a few verbal cues. actually i think this could be a great idea for a series! <br /><br />lots of love darling Adriene.<br />namaste*,sara romero paz,2021-03-11T09:04:54Z,0

I do enjoy your 30 day series but find it a challenge to follow without your voice guidance on the last day. I Find myself glancing at the video more which in turn makes for a difficult practice.

Yoga with Adriene gave me the tools to let my body get into the pose gentely, in a way that feels good, instead of just trying to  do the pose perfectly, even if I can easily do it.<br />So now I also practice moving with my breath in dance classes, and it feels amazing! <br />Thank you so much Adriene and everyone else practicing around the world, Love ya!",adi ofek,2021-03-10T19:33:53Z,0

"At first I like to say thank you very much lovely Adriene. Its been a pleasure to do Yoga with you. You helped me very much to trust and focus on myself. I think you and the breath will help me in the future also. <br />With this last session I have my probelms, it stresses me out to look all the time what you doing. Although I like to do free Yoga for myself, especially on the evenings (or at night haha). <br />Im proud of myself that I did this awesome challenge, but I needed a little more time then a month (nearly two i guess). Sometimes I didnt feel like doing that &quot;much&quot; Yoga and sometimes it just didnt fit in my day. Im a little sad about this part of the journey, feels like I haven&#39;t done what I wanted. But Im happy too because ive taken myself time with this. Does anyone feel the same? Plans are there to change right?",Sophie,2021-03-10T11:50:49Z,1

"Thank you so much for this journey Adriene! It took me longer to complete, but I&#39;m so happy I did. Although I&#39;m sad it&#39;s the last session, I&#39;m exited to continue my journey and discover new things as well as come back and do this one again to see my progress and remind myself of the importance of Breath ❤<br />I realise now I might have misunderstood the last session haha! I went exploring on my own and only looked up to get some guidelines from time to time. It might not have been what was intended, but it was so much fun (and terrifying) to improvise and follow my breath through everything you&#39;ve taught us. I will definitely do this session again and follow in your footsteps next time!<br />Sending you so much love and gratitude for sharing your time and love with us ❤",Krokodilpudding,2021-03-09T09:07:28Z,0
"Hi Adriene, Great sequence and a fine last episode for the 30 day breath yoga journey, but I must say I was quite uncomfortable with the way this video was made. The lack of voice-over means that even if &quot;you know the vocabulary&quot;, you have to twist yourself constantly to see the screen, i.e. what happens next. So please for the future reference: keep the vocal instructions there, so the viewer can concentrate on the main things like breathing and moving along with the breath.",MJ Siik,2021-03-09T08:05:48Z,0

@Yoga With Adriene of course! it was odd too because there was no indication that any commercials would be in the video from the scroll track. Usually they have the yellow bars at the bottom of the scroll track saying when a commercial will appear in the video. Appreciate Adriene and the team that help makes these classes available for us!

Routine, consistency and setting time aside for anything to achieve something in my life is a real struggle for me.  I am not giving myself any promises anymore, but I am going to try taking it ONE BREATH at a time now, and see what happens.

I&#39;ve always had goals in mind when it came to yoga, expand on my flexibility, maintain my balance, and obtain the splits, and this was an incredible journey which taught me so much more about yoga that I never thought or considered to be a part of it. I almost didn&#39;t want it to end, and that&#39;s definitely part of what made this an emotional experience in the end. It was hard to return after I started crying, so I just focused on my breathing. Thank you for such an incredible experience.",Tenem,2021-03-07T00:45:09Z,0

I love these practices sooooo much and have been trying to do the 30 day challenge for years and never been able to complete it or stick to anything in my life. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever made it the whole way through... it&#39;s the 5th of March but have been been doing Adrienes 10 minute sun salutations most days in between. I almost cried when I couldn&#39;t todays one... I started to feel panicy because I didn&#39;t know what to do so just sat there feeling badly. I couldn&#39;t come up with moves myself... which I know is my own fault... and I couldn&#39;t see what Adriene was doing because I have to take my glasses off during practice. I just really wanted to do this!!! : ( I feel a bit defeated. I know that is on me... just wished I could have been brave enough to get there : Z Not all of us have the same skill sets and some of us just aren&#39;t ready to go it alone. I trust I will in time... but yeah ... just wish I&#39;d finished my first 30 day journey cos it meant a lot to me to do so. Still luv ya Adriene : D,Patrice Anderson,2021-03-04T21:02:01Z,0

I would like to say though that while I can appreciate you wanting to take a break from verbally guiding us, I found it extremely distracting to have to keep looking at the TV to see if you had moved on and to what pose.  I would appreciate it if you could just please name the pose you are transitioning into so that I can continue to participate while paying attention to my body instead of the tv.

I was really scared to start because I am overweight and I was terrified that I wouldn&#39;t be able to do poses correctly or be able to lift myself off the ground. The progress I&#39;ve made with your help in these past few weeks has been tremendous, not only physically but mentally. I&#39;m not scared to step on the mat anymore or try new poses. I allow myself to make mistakes and to try a pose in a different way that works for my body. I&#39;ve begun to accept myself, &quot;flaws&quot; and all.

And most important, I am sure that I will continue yoga practice, because I absolutely fell in love!<br />Thank you Adriene, thank you Benji, thank you Luna (my cat) and thank everyone who was doing this.  🥰<br />I feel that this is really a new beginning.

It was not easy but it was lovely. I just kept looking at the screen to figure out what you were doing. Perhaps with time I could learn to predict your wonderful movements. Thank you so much.,Mona Mange,2021-03-04T01:36:15Z,1
I just like to Thank you for Adriene i have enjoyed every second even when I could  do some of the excise your words and encouragement push me through. Learning power of your  breath  was a game changer for me.  I also liked how you made each lesson had humour at the right time  to take away the seriousness away from me and allowing me to  be. Not  complain that I can&#39;t do this also remember is a journey of small steps not  race. Once again thank you. <br />P.S I did stop when you said that you will not be talking LOL,Ian Lindo,2021-03-04T00:35:53Z,1
"I started on Feb 1 because I was challenged (I know it&#39;s not the best frame of mind for this, but it got me to show up. That counts for something, right?) by dear friends of mine and finished yesterday.<br />This has been eye-opening for me. I have been a martial artist for most of my adult life and that was a journey to my strengths that I desperately needed in my life.<br />It also left a lot to be learned.<br />These past 30 days have been a journey to my weaknesses: my impatience, my inflexible hips, my short hamstrings, the clenched jaw... It was very exciting to be in a space where I felt welcome with how I am right now and where I get to explore without a need to arrive anywhere. It even allowed me to have fun with these weaknesses to an extend that I feel confident to engage with them in the future without getting discouraged by them.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly the warrior poses have been my favorites, especially followed by the counter twist. My biggest achievement was finding a second of balance in crow that surprised me so much I lost it again. This last session I free-styled and I the hair on the back of my neck stand up with excitement about how nice everything was. I will keep on doing Yoga, probably dealing with lower back and hamstring first.<br /><br />Thank you for a little light inside that I get to carry around with me.",David Schmitz,2021-03-04T00:17:47Z,1

"Finally completed this today; like...just now!  I know I&#39;m totally late with life happening and all, but I&#39;m here.  One of the small but significant improvements was the cat-cow and the twisting pose (forgot the name), where I&#39;m able to reach further with both, given a tight shoulder blade area.  Will continue to work on that.  Side note: Is it just my eyes playing tricks on me or is Benji a slight tint of blue?  Must be my monitor or the reflection of the yoga mat/carpet (haha).  I also noticed that you have an image of him at the end of every time stamp in all the sessions.  I can see you love him dearly.  Your passion and dedication to your life&#39;s calling shows, especially in today&#39;s class.  For that, I thank you sincerely, Adriene!  Namaste, my friend!  :-)",Owen Chang,2021-02-28T21:44:53Z,1
I started on the 30th of January and ended today (February 28). It was totally awesome to stretch and move my body everyday. The most surprising thing to me was that I indeed did have the knowledge from the past 30 days to flow for the complete time of this video without even looking at what you were doing. Thank you so much for all the mindfulness I had because of this challenge in this stressful time as I start my exam period here in Germany on Friday. Now that I completed this challenge I can finally see myself moving my body everyday with great pleasure. See you in you next video💞🌼,Ella Belle,2021-02-28T21:41:29Z,1
Late to the party but congratulations to everyone who did this :) Only just finished this today. I usually never comment on things like this for fear of embarrassment and my own cynicism that creeps in but I think it’s important to share. I didn’t make it to the mat some days but I kept going. This was far from easy but it has been so rewarding. A month after the 30 days - getting to the finish with the trust and encouragement to do it ourselves was an extraordinary ending to a lovely journey. Thank-you so much Adriene and to everyone who took part - you are all legends. What an odd but lovely connection we all share. Excited for what’s next.

"The first time through I struggled to get through a full 50 minutes.   I also felt a profound sadness and tears even flowed.   This time, I completed this session - and although it was still a challenge, it was easier as I turned to the breath and dug deep.   I am going to continue with the Move Calendar and will be exploring other videos for my practice.  Thank you Adriene for providing this space and support.  Namaste.",Holli Vybez,2021-02-28T18:13:30Z,0

"Adriene, I truly loved this practice and was honoured to do this with you and the community! <br /><br />Side note, a friend and I have been wondering throughout the series... 🤔what is the blueish/dark structure behind you in the yard. Is it a fence? Tarp? A shadow? Retaining wall? We have been trying to figure this out and it tends to look different depending on the lighting, haha. A little bit of monkey mind perhaps 😏.

"I expected something totally different from today. When I first realized that there wouldn&#39;t be a voice to guide me I felt anxious but than I thought I was ready. Sometimes I was turning my neck to look at adriene and sometimes I was behind, some times I was perfectly sinchronized, some other times I ended up in a totally different pose. That&#39;s ok, has been a beautiful practice. I didn&#39;t miss too much Adriene&#39;s reflective moments because I gave voice to my reflections and I even managed to do myself some compliments. Definitely I will return to this practice. In the end, I cried hearing the familiar music, I have been part of a beautiful journey and it&#39;s just the beginning❤️ namaste 🙏 p.s. sorry for the english mistakes, It&#39;s not my mother tongue 🙈",Grazia Di Nola,2021-02-28T10:17:38Z,0

"You can not do humanity a better favor, a higher mercy than to teach it to fish... Than to teach it to be free, independant, teach it to rely on itself, make it see the imense potential and strenght and faith that it needs not to be led but need to be it&#39;s own leader... It&#39;s own healer... It&#39;s own shelter... I cried too... Like many here. I cried because Adriene was there to support me but I cried more because for the first time ever, not hearing her instructions, I realised I was able to support myself... Thank you Adriene for your profoundness... It&#39;s unexpressable with words so simply - thank you dear Adriene.",Marina Stanic Palasti,2021-02-27T23:59:59Z,0

"I ended up being three weeks behind, but I finally finished!! This whole journey has been such an enlightening experience for me, and though Day 30 was an emotional one, it was by far my favorite. I smiled the whole practice because I realized how far I had come, listened to my breath, and told myself “I am strong” when I started to tire. This year has already been pretty rough and this challenge has helped me get back into the right mind space and awareness of my body and its needs. Thank you so much for this wonderful journey, Adriene (and Benji!) It really meant the world!☺️",Morgan Cameron,2021-02-27T22:20:22Z,0
"I have never done a freestyle yoga session like this and it really helped boost my confidence in my yoga practice. Thank you Adriene!

"I started my journey a little later. I just had my day 30 today, and I have tears of joy in my eyes. They started to overcome me at the end of “Begin” when the intro/outro song started playing. I was screaming out of my heart “oh my god I have goosebumps” and then the tears came out because I was so incredibly proud of myself that I made it. And listening to the intro piano one last time after this amazing self-practice was just an absolute momemt of magic to me. THANK YOU SO SO MUCH. For me the beginning starts now :)",happyviolet21,2021-02-26T18:19:25Z,0

I have ADHD and struggle staying focused and just got my YTT 200 certification and want to keep my practice up and did not expect the amount of growth in the breath that I earned through the last 30+ days in this journey.

"Amazing practice. I felt so happy, literally felt the breeze of the ocean on my face. And I also get very emotional - once in the middle and at the end, but these were very purifying tears, gentle tears of joy. I am so happy that I breathe, I realized that I do not need anythig more.

"Well that made me cry. Joyously. The initial fear of &quot;what, all by myself!?&quot; subsided once I acknowledged the fear but didn&#39;t let it take hold, and trusted that I knew enough to do it - that my vocabulary was sufficient to do about 50 minutes of yoga essentially unassisted. And once I got started and realised quite quickly that indeed I could, the tears came. As a bonus, I was just lifting my hands to my head, lips and heart (for the right thoughts, words and deeds/feelings) when the video closed. Thank you for this wonderful 30-day journey. Transformative it has most certainly been. I think I might just go right back to Day 1 and &quot;begin again&quot; :)  Namaste, everyone.",Johnny Day,2021-02-26T08:13:03Z,0

I can&#39;t believe that I finished the 30 day yoga journey without ever skipping a day! holy cow. that&#39;s pretty cool. I found myself going through old flows trying really hard not to watch you but to just feel my body and listen to what it wanted. I kept today very very low-key on my body because I have felt kinda sick and weak all day. But at one moment I took a peak at you and we were doing the same flow and I got way too pumped.

"Hi Adriene. Thanks so much for inviting me along on such an amazing journey. Have really enjoyed this challenge. I have a small suggestion - although I love the idea of the &quot;mic off&quot; I find I am constantly looking up, interrupting my pose to see if you have moved on. I wonder if a compromise might be to just have a short &quot;ding&quot; go off when you change poses (that would be our cue to look up to see what&#39;s next)... Just an idea. See you on the next journey. Namaste",Jodi Redmond,2021-02-26T00:14:42Z,0
"Adriene, I just wanted to thank you for this journey and for all you do, I&#39;ve really enjoyed them. I had discovered you and your yoga videos earlier on in the pandemic on Prime and moved on from there. I had discovered what I can do and I also discovered my limitations and I acknowledge both of those parts of me. I have really grown more positive about myself and my body as a result and I have you to thank for that.

"As a former yoga instructor, I really enjoyed this series! My daughter in-law got me to do it as a challenge with her. Just to add to Adriene&#39;s amazing teaching, I would like to add a little encouragement. To those of you who had trouble doing a class with no verbal instruction, I understand. However, A is trying to teach you the very important aspects of a home practice. The name of this series, BREATH, is so true. Breath connects your body, mind and spirit. It helps you get through the more challenging poses and it keeps you in the moment. If nothing else, breathe! That is the most important thing. Next, FEEL; you notice how A stops for moments throughout the practice just to check in on how she is feeling. Tune in to your body! Lastly, Trust. You may not be able to do everything in the course. See how you feel and do something else that your body is prompting you to do. It is YOUR yoga practice! Listen to your body and just go with the flow. I have had wrist tendonitis throughout this course so Plank Pose and Face Down Dog were out. I either adapted the poses by going onto my forearms or I stayed in Childs Pose or I just did what I felt like doing! When it&#39;s a home practice feel free to do whatever your body tells you to do.<br />Lastly, Adriene, it was a real pleasure to take this journey with you. I do a lot of your classes. You have a beautiful way of explaining things in a clear fashion that is also soulful. I picked up a lot of nifty variations that are so much fun! Thank you and keep up the great work!

I&#39;ve been practicing with Adriene for years and I truly enjoy the tradition of following my own flow on the last day. After all, the process teaches you to trust yourself. For me, these 50 minutes passed surprisingly fast and I loved applying what I have learned in the past 30 days. I barely looked at the video and when I did, I often found myself in the same pose as Adriene, which made me smile. Thank you, Adriene, for your amazing work!

I will start the other one month journey tomorrow morning! :)",OLI,2021-02-24T04:17:08Z,0

"I can&#39;t believe I finally finished the 30-day journey. Thank you Adriene for allowing us to take the lead in our practice today. I was hesitant at first because you weren&#39;t going to lead us but when I told myself to just breathe and use what I learned from the journey, the flow came naturally. I am so sentimental because I didn&#39;t think I would finish this journey (first yoga challenge of any kind for me) and to think I that I actually did it and reached the end makes me so proud. Thank you Adriene for your kindness, teachings and positive energy during this beautiful journey; it was an honor.",Jennifer Ramirez,2021-02-24T03:43:16Z,1
"I made a promise to myself when I started this practice that I would see it through to the end. My intention was to stop beating myself up with exercise, to heal-to breathe, and to love what my body can do. It wasn&#39;t always easy to press play. I had to overcome feelings of guilt that I should be doing something more intense. There were difficult days- days I didn&#39;t want to sit still and just be. but I needed this. I loved this ending. It allowed me to realize just how much I had learned and sparked some creativity in me that I thought I lost a long time ago. ❤️ I finally found what feels good!",Lauren Hurley,2021-02-24T00:40:20Z,0
The way that I was taking my screen across the room with me trying to keep up 🤣😭. Got emotional in the end there when I realized I won&#39;t just have another day in the series but I&#39;m hopeful for the future. Thank you so much for everything you&#39;ve taught me and I&#39;m looking forward to more 😊,captainhindsight11,2021-02-23T22:03:49Z,0

"Muchas gracias Adriene. <br />It&#39;s my first 30 day challenge, and I arranged it so I could finish today, on my 31st birthday. It&#39;s been an amazing journey. I am so proud of myself, so proud of everyone that did it...in those difficult times this practice have been my guide, and I am extremely grateful for showing me how yoga can help the world we live in!

"I can&#39;t believe I finally completed this journey with you 😭! I started off late and today was my last day of the challenge. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past year and my therapist recommended I do yoga. At first I was hesitate but I kept pushing through and showing up even on my bad days where I was having thoughts of not wanting to live. Thank you Adriene so much! You have truly changed my life, given me hope, and I look forward to doing more of your past Yoga challenges as well as any new yoga videos in the upcoming future!

"I completed day 30 a couple of days ago. When you said you were going to take the mic off I freaked out for a minute. Then once I started working with my breath I knew I could do it. My practice was not the same as yours, and it wasn&#39;t very elegant, but it was what I needed. I felt accomplished at the end and so happy. Thank you for building my confidence over the 30 days it took to complete Breath.",Lisa Lewis,2021-02-23T17:32:11Z,0

"Wow. What an accomplishment for everyone who made it to this day! And thank you Adriene for being our teacher and guiding light thru it all. I really learned that it&#39;s ok to start off a little rocky, missing days yet you can always come back in. Around day 12 was when I finally set in my mind to stay with it and stay consistent - just showing up to the mat is an accomplishment (of course we all know what happens when you get there!). The second most important thing - &quot;my breath is my anchor.&quot; I really appreciated that mantra and find it very useful. Physically, I&#39;m a big, tall guy and very inflexible. I loathe sitting crosslegged and especially getting on the floor. So my intention for my practice is to change that, to get comfortable with these motions. It&#39;s part of my culture, my son loves when I come to play on the floor with him, and I paint murals for a living so I&#39;m always having to be on the floor. This 30 day journey has been a blessing for me. I&#39;m more flexible, more calm, and feel more centered. Fa&#39;afetai tele lava Adriene, namaste.",jaypzl,2021-02-23T17:10:33Z,0
"I think the idea here was to do your own thing, not follow Adriene. It was a whole new experience being truly alone with my thoughts during this- something that scared me at first but allowed me to explore what feels good to me today. I realized that some things were easier than when I started. It took me almost 2 months but I did it. Thank you Adriene.",Jennifer Zapf,2021-02-23T16:05:08Z,6
"I’m behind, but I completed it! This was a eye opening journey and I so hope that I can find my zen in future yoga practices. I cried as I whispered I am strong. <br /><br />What a beautiful 30 days. <br /><br />Namaste everyone xox",Kamilla Flahiff,2021-02-23T15:25:06Z,2

"Just finishing Breath nearing the end of February as I had to stop when I had gallbladder surgery!  To everyone who experienced frustration at the silence and wished there were cues, I totally get it, I had the same reaction my first 30 days of Yoga which was in 2018.  I remember stopping the video and doing a different one instead because I couldn&#39;t &#39;keep up&#39; and &#39;get it right&#39;.  If I&#39;m honest I felt a little cheated!  I&#39;ve continued to do at home yoga with Adriene since and my experience of the final practice in January 2020 and this one in 2021 is so different.  I start slowly, making my own flow and then glance at the screen when I can for ideas of flows or poses to move into in a few minutes.  I love that I can create a whole practice for myself with a little inspiration from Adriene and I absolutely see and believe in the rationale for doing it this way!  My advice is to stick with it and by next January you might have a wholly different experience of the final practice.  Sending lots of love to everyone who has started 2021 with yoga, may the year bring wonderful things for us all xx",Alanna Salter,2021-02-23T10:30:34Z,1

Strained a muscle in my neck about 15 mins in looking to the screen and had to stop :(  I love your vids and done them a long time but having no audio cues really threw me here. Normally I can practice with just audio guidance. I know the eventual goal of yoga is to make your own practice but I don&#39;t think those who can do that would bother with Youtube instruction. Sorry to be negative - I will be back when my neck heals &lt;3,Gary Brown,2021-02-23T09:07:53Z,1

It took me 50 days to do this 30 day challenge. I have such a hard time with perfectionism and was afraid that not completing every single session the day it was realized would give me anxiety and lead to me giving up as soon as I missed a day (which was inevitable as a person with a small child and a baby and a full time job). I even talked to a therapist about this and she said why do you have to do 30 days of yoga in 30 days? I felt like such a dummy. I&#39;m so proud of myself for completing this journey!!! Thank you Adriene!!!,Rhiannon Admidas,2021-02-22T00:09:21Z,114

"I completed my journey today, because I started it a few weeks later. <br />It’s incredible, I truly have no words. It’s amazing how one person can create such thing like this. Everyday, I’m doing yoga on my mat, alone, but I never feel alone. I feel supported, I feel connected, I feel stronger. I’m so so grateful that I discovered this. I’m a vocal coach and I’m telling all my singing students how I’m such a fan of “Yoga with Adriene”. The connection of the mind, body and voice is so strong, so I’ve already started thinking about implementing yoga in my singing classes. <br /><br />Adriene, it’s a funny thing to say, but I think that I really love you. From miles away, you feel like some kind of sister. You must know that it’s very special what you do. You inspire me. Thank you for existing.",Debbie Jacob,2021-02-21T19:31:15Z,6

"(30/365)<br />i&#39;m feeling very emotional right now because this journey has come to an end. it&#39;s especially emotional because this is the first 30 day journey i&#39;ve completed since 2017! there have been a lot of difficult things and I had lost trust in myself to commit to a practice, but I wanted to prove to myself that i was capable, and I did! it took a bit longer, but i&#39;m proud of myself for completing the full 30 days! i&#39;m especially proud because this was the first time i was able to go with my own flow without hanging around waiting for Adriene to tell me what to do next. even though the 50 minutes was daunting at first, i ended up needing extra time at the end!<br />it&#39;s been a pleasure practicing with you all, and I&#39;m honoured to have Adriene (and Benji) as my guide and safe place. here&#39;s to trusting ourselves, and trusting the process. it&#39;s worth it. you&#39;re worth it.<br />love you, see you tomorrow &lt;3",honey Blue,2021-02-21T01:25:31Z,0

"Hi Adrienne!! Just wanted to thank you for such a beautiful month;) It began as such a difficult time filled with hopelessness and grief yet slowly but surely I transformed into the more grounded, optimistic, and aware version of myself I was searching for (all through breathing!!). At the beginning of today’s practice I was intimidated because I didn’t think myself capable of curating my own flow without guidance. But with your reassurance and all the tools you taught along the way I stopped doubting myself and just trusted that I could:) I even shed a few tears during my meditation because of how grateful I was for dedicating the time and effort to myself for 30 days to start prioritizing my overall health. Thank you for all the work that you do and I can’t wait to keep going on my yoga journey&lt;3",Haley Lifrieri,2021-02-20T19:18:11Z,0
"I just did my 30th day - I don&#39;t even know what to say.

I took my time, I BREATHED, it wasn&#39;t perfect, but I went with how I felt and moved and breathed freely. I can&#39;t believe the difference in just 30 days. My confidence, my strength, core, flexibility, my trust in myself, everything. I still have a long way to go but I&#39;m so proud of the journey Adriene has taken me on and am so grateful for all she has taught me. I feel so emotional and just fantastic. Thank you Adriene and of course, Benji! The community you have built up around your amazing talents is incredible and one I&#39;m proud to be apart of. I hope you are keeping safe and we are all thinking of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Namaste &lt;3",Amy Leveridge,2021-02-20T15:06:29Z,0

"This is my second 30 day challenge and this last day was the hardest. I kept on thinking what to do next and if im doing it right. Maybe an idea to make one like this and one with a voice over to do it together?<br />I&#39;m doing this because of my anxiety disorder ( and other mental health problems) and every time I do yoga I feel a little bit more peace. I&#39;m not gonna lie, I do this in the evening. But it&#39;s a very big step for me to do this and sometimes it&#39;s really hard to step on the mat and I don&#39;t do it every day but I do my best and that&#39;s the important thing. <br />Thank you!!",VerybigNOPE,2021-02-19T20:41:51Z,1

"Thank you so much Adriene and lovely Benji. I found this session, although longer, very soothing and comforting because I was able to follow your movements and keep up mostly. It just shows how much you have taught us all about the movements and breathing techniques that we can now do ourselves. I surprised myself too. <br />I’m sad that this monthly program has ended but I’m also happy and proud that I’ve been able to complete every session even though it’s taken me longer than a month!!! <br />I want to continue with your yoga. It’s brilliant and has done me so much good physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually and I want to keep that going daily now. Little and often seems to work well. <br />I’m very grateful and really enjoy yoga. It’s the first time I’ve stuck to it long term and you have been a saviour during our lockdowns.<br />Love to you both 💕💕💕🙏🏻👏🏻🇬🇧🌟",Carole Dodd,2021-02-19T18:29:03Z,0
"I&#39;ve watched your videos for years but I haven&#39;t done the 30 day yoga journey before all the way through and here I am! However I think not doing audio cues is a bit confusing. In passing I was excited to see a 50 minute session at the end woohoo!! If we were doing the same exact routine every-time this would totally make sense to do the routine together (It&#39;s very intuitive and I love it) but I feel like I&#39;m just lost without your voice now, you are so chatty and lovely and I miss hearing your voice. I enjoy the fact that you are holding space for us but that&#39;s not really why I watch your videos and I use other videos to hold space. I took a class on teaching yoga (I do not have my 200 hour yet thanks covid but I am not a beginner) but I feel like if I didn&#39;t have my own routine down already I would be totally lost today. So I guess I&#39;m doing my other yoga studios vinyasa flow today haha",Grace Kent,2021-02-19T18:02:28Z,1

"I know some were frustrated with the lack of verbal cues, but the way I understood it is that I should do my own thing based on what I&#39;ve learned, while Adriene did her own thing. At first, I was a bit worried but I did a whole 20 minutes of my own routine and occasionally I&#39;d look over and say hi to Adriene. I did run out of things to do, mostly because I tend to rush through the positions, but I think that&#39;s an important thing to notice about myself. I&#39;m going to try to freestyle again tomorrow with this video so that Adriene can be in the room with me.",Rosa,2021-02-19T16:03:57Z,0

"I remember stumbling upon this channel a couple of years ago and trying to do yoga... and failing miserably, hating myself every step of the way. Blaming myself for not sticking to routine etc. <br />Now I understand that then wasn&#39;t the right time for me. <br />Last year I started my journey of self love and radical self acceptance. It isn&#39;t easy and not every day is great, but I&#39;m still here! So it&#39;s a win! <br />I did this 30 day journey from place of self love and, most importantly, self acceptance. Adriene&#39;s words helped me so much through this month and a half (I took breaks:) ) and today was surprising! No guidance! It was so interesting and freeing letting my body flow freely. By the end of the practice I am filled with such joy and love! And surprising sense of unity? Of being a part of something bigger and better. Feeling the world around me.<br />It was like coming home. Like a warm hug.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriene! Namaste!",Siberiabird,2021-02-18T17:58:36Z,0

"2 weeks late with a few days&#39; break for an injury (not YWA-related lol), and when I first heard this was gonna be an almost hour long one I thought I&#39;d never make it through. Even during the opening bit, when she said it was okay if we laid on the mat the whole time, I thought that would be me for the last half of it at least. <br /><br />Did I stumble a couple times? Yep. Did I fall out of the one-legged poses a couple times? Heck yeah I did. <br /><br />But did I hold out to the end, even when I was sure my forehead sweat was making my mat slippery during child&#39;s pose? Why yes, yes I did. And did I also hold crow pose for longer than I ever had before? Hell yes I did.<br /><br />Thank you, Adriene. After this 30 days, I feel stronger, healthier (mentally and physically), and more centered than I have in... years? decades? Ever? I can&#39;t decide. But I&#39;m definitely going to keep up the daily practice. &lt;3",Elizabeth Moser,2021-02-18T16:59:13Z,0

"Adriene, oh I have got so many things to tell you about. In 2020 I decided to create my own bucket list. Mostly because of things that happened in the world. I realized that I have so many things that I want to do but I have never done. One of them was yoga practice, two weeks straight, at least two weeks. Also in October 2020 I started my first year at uni. And it was the whole emotional rollercoaster. By the end of that year I felt blue nearly everyday. I felt like I was living in the nightmare. Stress and depression were literally my close friends. I thought that I was hopeless, that I can do nothing. I had big dreams that I thought I would never make come true. And that was a time when I noticed that you have just started this yoga journey. It was a sign for me. I joined this journey 30 days ago. Now I&#39;m here, after all of the journey, feeling so good. You helped me, when I thought that nobody can help me. Yoga taught me not giving up. There was many poses that I had to struggle with but even though I tried. Also I noticed how my body strength improved. Now I&#39;m starting to love my body again. And loving myself. I&#39;m proud of myself because I HAVE TRIED. If something is not for me, if I did it wrong I&#39;m not mad, because I know that I did my best. Yoga helped me with feeling down, with my anger issues and show me that I can do everything, but I need to trust myself. Thank you so much for this journey. When I saw that day 30 is 50 minutes long and without your advices, I thought that I won&#39;t do it. I literally panicked because I thought I&#39;ll do something wrong. I did it without any break. When I collapsed, I told myself that I&#39;m doing great and came back to the practice. After these beautiful 30 days, I know that I&#39;ll stay with you longer. I&#39;ll definitely check your other yoga journeys. Maybe it&#39;s time for Home? <br />It supposed to be just two weeks but you show me the beauty of this practice and made me fell in love with yoga. Thank you so much for just being yourself 💕<br /><br /><br /><br />(Sorry for all the mistakes I made, I&#39;m from Poland and I know that I could made some of them. I hope you&#39;ve understand everything I wanted to tell)",Klaudia,2021-02-18T10:32:33Z,0

Better late than never. 😉 <br /><br />I wanted to thank you Adriene for showing me the wonders of yoga and reminding me to find what feels good. You reminded me to remember to appreciate and love myself by making time for myself and by  breathing love in and breathing love out. I also wanted to thank Benji for being a source of inspiration. Seeing him show up to the mat everyday of this journey made me see that I could do it too and that once I got to the mat, I wouldn&#39;t regret it and that the hardest part was already over. So thank you both for everything. ❤️<br /><br />This honestly was a life changing experience. It changed me for the better and I&#39;m thankful for it. Stay safe everyone!

"And here we are.... the end of these incredible 30 days of yoga with you Adriene ! 🥺 <br />I write with emotion and tears in my eyes because this adventure has brought me a lot, I breathe better than before in a lot of stressful, anxious situations etc; I am more patient than before, I take the time to enjoy what surrounds me and my breathing! And at the physical level too! I finally like a sport, I am in a hurry to start each session and I end up feeling peaceful each time! 😌 <br />Adriene, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this journey, you have helped me and you have surely helped a lot of people here! THANK YOU ❤️ <br />And everyone present here! We did it! Your comments were truly supportive, thank you too ! <br />I send you all love, joy &amp; peace 💗 (and see you on a next Adriene video and a next 30 days yoga journey 😉  ) <br />Namaste 🙏🏻",Alexia,2021-02-17T09:31:54Z,0

Maybe you wanted to quit.  Maybe you did, but then came back.  Maybe this was easy.  Maybe it was hard.  Maybe you should just sit on your mat and think how awesome you are for making it.<br /><br /><br />I know that when I walk away from this laptop and enjoy my final day right now, I will sit on my mat and think how thankful I am to Adriene.

The last session I didn’t get - spent a lot of time craning and trying to copy Adriene.<br /><br />Then I re read the comments and changed my mindset, I didn’t need to copy Adriene - she was my guide  who I could follow if I wished but I could also just go with the flow and follow what I wanted to do.<br /><br />So I did and enjoyed it.

I never imagined doing yoga from listening to my own body and coming up with my own routine. Of course it was a little messy, but I did it!! Thank you Adriene!!

"I finally finished!!! This has been such an amazing journey for me. I learned to show up on the mat but I also learned to take breaks when I really needed it (injury) and not to push myself for a &quot;challenge.&quot; I was nervous today about doing 50 minutes of unguided yoga but it was great. Yoga today for me looked like 35 minutes of asana, followed by 15 minutes of breathing, getting distracted by my bedframe, getting distracted by my thoughts, random poses, and a really great game of fetch with my dog.

"This was emotional for me, too. Realizing that I have the ability to do this practice on my own when I just trust myself and listen to what feels right in the moment was remarkable. I was very proud that I was able to stay with my breath, letting a few thoughts come and go here and there. <br />This practice was very special to me, especially after a long day of classes. Everything was coming in one ear and out the other. As soon as I got on the mat, though, I felt very centered and strong.

"That was so interesting. We were together and yet separate. I went with some of my own random movements that I remembered from past practices that just sounded good to me. Sometimes I would look up and see you doing something that seemed good to me, so I went with you, a step or a few behind. It was interesting to not have someone to tell me when to move on to the next move--I simply sat in it for as long or as short as I wanted. It didn&#39;t even feel like an hour. After experiencing that, I feel suddenly emotional. I&#39;m grateful to have been able to connect with myself in such a way, and to share such an intimate and personal experience with you.

I was over a week late starting &amp; couldn’t quite manage every single day but I complete all 30 days. This last one was so beautiful- I felt really emotional. I have been suffering with anxiety and this practice with the breath has helped me to slow down and take time out for myself without feeling guilty. I can’t thank you enough!

"Hi, I really love your videos and guidance! I have been doing your yoga for a long time and have always found so much benefit in it. I just wanted to comment to ask if you could maybe make a video just like this one but with audio cues or something so I can follow along easier. I find that this sort of video just makes me look at the screen more than usual because I don&#39;t know when you&#39;ve moved onto a new pose. I feel that I can do the poses just fine without guidance of how to do the poses but I like to use these videos as a frame for the sequence of poses. Please consider making a video just like this but maybe just say what pose is next. Thank you!",Jackie Smith,2021-02-14T21:08:11Z,2
This is my last day. Yoga was never my story. Just did not like it. Until one morning my inner message was... find out why! So I made a promise to myself to practise  for 30 day’s. If you still don’t like it after that period it is just not your thing. Than I found you Adrienne..... I started 11 days later. But after 2 weeks I did see/feel changes. I became more silenced within. Thank you for the journey. I will continue the yoga journey every day. With love. Suzanne,Suzanne Geelen,2021-02-14T20:36:14Z,1
"This is the first journey I have done all the way... I wasn’t consistent every single day, but it was the perfect one for me because this year my main goal is to practice more self love and I always remember Adriene asking the question “what if your breath was your spirit?” That always felt true to me and if that’s true than this was the best practice for self love as I got more in time with my spirit. <br />I gotta say this nearly hour long kind of freestyle with no guidance really was uncomfortable and awesome! It helped me listen to me. Adriene you’re one of the most insightful people I’ve ever interacted with! Your comments always come at the right time and it feels like therapy. Thanks for being a really bright spot in this crazy world!",Amanda Staley,2021-02-14T19:44:22Z,0

"It&#39;s February 14th, and I&#39;ve just done this - almost two weeks since finishing with practise 29. I&#39;d dome all of them up to day 27 without a break, and I&#39;d been so proud, but then life happened and I&#39;d fallen of track. I worked hard to remind myself yoga is about finding what feels good, about choosing every day what&#39;s best for me and not some perfect score, but a part of me was still disappointed. today I came back to this last practise, and as soon as I sat down in the mat, I started crying. The following 50 minutes I just spent with myself, paying attention to what my body and mind needed. it felt so cleansing, so healing. I&#39;m glad I came back.",Laura,2021-02-14T15:34:58Z,0

Finally getting my closure on BREATH today. It felt amazing to come back to yoga with this hour of freestyle.

"though I appreciated the silence, I would like to echo everyone else in saying a few voice prompts would definitely be helpful. otherwise I&#39;ve been avoiding day 30 for a few days, because I didn&#39;t want this journey to end, so its almost ironic that this video is entitled &quot;begin&quot; 🥺thank you, thank you, thank you!!! x ❤️brb scouring your page for more videos and more 30 day challenges",Jodi Williams,2021-02-14T04:37:44Z,1
"I finally made it!  Here&#39;s to a long lasting daily routine of healthy breathing!  I like that my routine had similar elements, but was very different from Adriene&#39;s routine- and that was okay, because it&#39;s what my body needed.  I still made some discoveries and learned something new about my body.",bluscorpion,2021-02-14T04:28:57Z,0

"I have gained so much from these videos and they are a part of my daily routine.  So grateful that they are available.  However, I do get super frustrated with the silent practice.  There is just no way to follow along without having to crane your neck in awkward positions to see what the next pose is.  If I wanted to just do my own thing, I wouldn&#39;t have turned the video on and what I need the help with is the transitions.  Would much prefer some sort of guidance to these.",Heather Fairless,2021-02-13T20:33:58Z,1

Even though I prefer hearing your soothing voice and cues I have to admit I enjoyed watching you go through your own practice as well as mine. You have amazing grace and beauty.

I&#39;m grateful for this practice. Its helped me so much mentally and physically, and I can&#39;t wait to continue this journey of discovery. This has been fun, challenging and 100% worth it. Wherever you are physically or mentally, make some time for this because for me, its benefits have gone beyond this platform. Very thankful, thankyou Adriene!",Amy Timmins,2021-02-13T11:13:24Z,0
"I put this last practice off for 2 days because the one hour time mark scared me off, so happy I got onto the mat to finish this journey. I also didn&#39;t feel guilty about the 3-4 days I didn&#39;t get on the mat, because those were days I was extremely tired and knew I&#39;d be better off heading to bed so even though I stayed away from the final day for 2 days, I&#39;m happy I did it now, it feels so much more fulfilling! This is the first 30 day journey of anything that I&#39;ve followed through, enjoyed and saw myself grow; started the first day in a bad mood, anxious, sore feet and my legs kept on trembling throughout the practice to finishing off the last day feeling stronger, balanced and at peace.  I&#39;m thankful to myself for showing up and taking this time for myself, thankful to the universe (and the YouTube algorithm) for putting these videos on my feed and thankful to Adriene for this journey and the love and calming energy she put into it. I&#39;ll definitely be practicing yoga much more often",toad,2021-02-13T10:40:30Z,1

I have put off doing today’s session all day because last 30 day yoga journey I hated day 30. This time I did it when I was ready with the intension of doing my own thing. I glanced at the videos a few times and thought oh yes I could try that. I gave myself permission not to feel I had to do the whole session and to my surprise I almost made it to the end. I didn’t love going solo but I actually did it. Wow. Thanks for all your guidance. I think I’m going to go back to day 1 and do it again.,Flourish Gifts,2021-02-13T05:25:24Z,0

"I finished BREATH today and I’m very proud of myself! I did some poses myself that felt right for me today and some I did with Adriene. Something new for me happened today in child’s pose with my arms back. Usually I feel like it’s just my own little safe space to curl up in, which is wonderful, but today I also felt it as an opening for my back body to stretch and expand, for myself to expand, almost like I was growing as a person if that makes sense. It brought a smile to my face that I found something new in a pose of done so many times. Thank you for this journey Adriene, I’m so grateful. I’m proud of myself and of being part of this community. Namaste 🙏",Maggie Hyler,2021-02-13T00:28:23Z,0
I am so proud of myself for doing this 30 day yoga journey - and I&#39;ve continued with daily yoga practice after this and am excited to keep it going!

"To everyone who&#39;s struggling without voice cues and has their experience ruined by looking at the screen: you&#39;re not supposed to! If you can&#39;t do it on your own, you&#39;ve missed all the lessons of the previous practices. But if you trust yourself and try, you might find that you can do much more than you think! Just breathe and move. Everything you need is already in you &lt;3<br /><br />On my first 30-day challenge finale, I was also annoyed and frustrated at the lack of vocal instruction. But now, a few years of daily yoga later, I look forward to it because I really do have the vocabulary, creativity and trust to simply listen to my body and find what feels good. I&#39;ve already been &quot;veering off the railroad tracks&quot; and doing yoga with eyes closed lately, and I don&#39;t need the voiceover because I can hear Adriene in my head anyway, even off the mat. But this time I made the practice completely my own, with lions instead of dogs, deeper focus in certain poses that I&#39;m normally too distracted to truly enjoy and an involuntary pause in the middle because the HOME theme song made me cry, of course. I ended up just staring at the screen for a while, mesmerized by Adriene&#39;s gracefulness and finding new motivation to keep going because I want to be like that someday.<br /><br />Thank you so much for letting me come along for this journey, and all the people in the comments creating the most wholesome community on youtube. I&#39;m so happy to be a part of it.<br />Keep Breathing.<br />Namaste &lt;3",Yuzik,2021-02-12T22:07:32Z,0

I pushed through &amp; only missed one day. I made it a priority to show up to the mat. This was very emotional, I started to cry mid way through this session. I reflected on where I started inactive and battling depression. Now I’m down 7lbs and losing inches. I’m stronger and much more disciplined. Feeling good overall and looking forward to continuing the practice.<br /><br />Adriene you cracked me up when you stepped forward without looking down that made me laugh 😊 you spoke with your eyes 👀",Black_Butterfly,2021-02-12T21:22:00Z,0

"This is my first YWA 30 day journey so I didn&#39;t know what to expect on day 30 with 50 minutes. It was incredible. I did my own routine, putting into my practice all that I have learned this month and finding what felt good. It was amazing. I can&#39;t thank you enough for this gift you&#39;ve given to us. I breathed, I played, I smiled, I felt strong, I challenged myself, I cared for myself, I listened... Thank you so much, Adriene. I never thought this would happen but I&#39;m ready to get into the February yoga calendar. Which is awesome for me, daily yoga? I never tough I could/would do this. And enjoy it! After every practice I feel so much better, physically, mentally and spiritually. I feel like I&#39;m finding silence and stillness. And that&#39;s priceless.

It was me that I was looking for and it is me that I find and learn more about each day. Now I take my hand and walk into the distance and disappear into the crowd. <br />I&#39;m most proudest of letting go of wanting to keep up with everyone and instead finding when I am and starting from there.

"&lt;This comment was NO translator, as much as possible!😁&gt;<br />The final day , I stopped to use the translator for everything. Because , I believe me and you. ( So, maybe strange English!)<br />I studying English, For Beginners. I also love yoga.  And I met  Yoga with Adriene , and everyone.<br />I often couldn&#39;t understand the words , until today.<br />Today&#39;s practice, I surprised No words. But, Adrien said we have a &quot;Vocabulary&quot;. It was truth. We did it! We had gotten the vocabulary through 29 days journey. I impress this thing. It is a big awareness. So, I trying now, also English too.<br />Thank you all. Adririne, you are gentle, beautiful and cutie guide. And You are also English teacher, For me!<br />Thank you to alive in the same era.

"As someone who is new to yoga and was learning a lot throughout this process, I was really disappointed in this video. I don&#39;t know if the intention was for us to improvise or to somehow be able to follow along without audio but I found it incredibly frustrating as someone who doesn&#39;t quite have the vocabulary yet to create my own flow.<br /><br />I appreciate the knowledge and the guidance so not trying to be too negative or anything but I really think if this is being geared towards beginners, keeping the cues in is a good idea. How am I supposed to know what is happening on the screen? Is there some yoga secret I am missing?

"I may have interpreted this wrong, but I took this as an invitation to do whatever the next right thing felt like for me and trust that! At first I was so thrown off that she was not going to speak but then I just started going to poses and transitions that felt right and Adriene was just kind of doing her own thing next to me. Like two buds. I would look up to see what she was doing next if I needed an idea but it was really cool to just go to poses that gave me what I needed. Thanks Adriene! You rock don&#39;t ever change.",Christina Chavez,2021-02-11T23:59:34Z,0

"Today was my final day. I never finish the 30 day challenge in 30 days because I don&#39;t do yoga on the day that I dance. Last year, when I discovered YWA I did one 30 day challenge after the other, with a few other videos sprinkled in. With dance and a few unavoidable missed days, I figure I did yoga over 300 days last year. If that&#39;s not showing up for myself, I don&#39;t know what is. Who cares about doing 30 days in a row! Yoga, and YWA, is a core part of my life now, I now know the part of myself that shows up for myself, and I AM blessed. ❤️🙏A🙏❤️",Lisa Buell,2021-02-11T19:13:44Z,0
"This was wonderful Adriene! At first the thought of no microphone scared me but after 5 or so minutes of following the breath I found myself just listening to the body and going with the flow, occasionally glancing at the screen for inspiration! This 30 day journey has been transformative and I just want to say thankyou for opening up this new world of exploration to everyone! You are a blessing :)",Ōkami,2021-02-11T18:27:15Z,0
I lost 10 pounds and am now at a healthier 200 thanks to Breath&#39;s daily practices Adriene. The power of yoga is indeed transformative and empowering! 😁🙌 I hope to continue this journey and lose another 20-30 pounds as yoga is the only exercise I can do that doesn&#39;t cause my pain to flare up! 🤩,Nicholas James,2021-02-11T18:09:24Z,1

"I actually cried when we knocked on heavens door in that, it just felt like such an amazing release, I have been doing your yoga daily for a year and it has changed my life and by doing the non verbal practices I am able to see how far I’ve come and it is the one healthy practice I’ve ever nurtured for myself that isn’t about weight or pressures of looking good.

I was scared starting this practice, but it was the first time I truly trusted my body. I didn&#39;t think about my movements, I just listed to my body and what it needed. Thank you so much for providing this space. You have truly changed my life and I am so thankful to you for that. Hearing the closing music at the end filled me with so much love.

Then I finally let go and let my body lead me and I am impressed and surprised about how far I have come and how much my body remembers.<br />I started the 30 day yoga days late into January but I have stuck to it and even have a 30-day streak.

"Up until now, I found this day 30 tradition really hard. Say what? I have to find my own way on the mat, for 50 minutes?? But guess what? I actually do have the vocabulary! This might have been the most interesting and rewarding yoga session yet, finding my own flow, smiling when I heard your voice in my head – Squeeze and lift, squeeze and lift!

"When the closing theme song came up, I started crying. Also, in the middle of the practice, I decided to come to plank pose and I whispered to myself &quot;I am strong&quot;; I started crying as well. I was amazed to find that plank pose is that space I needed after various days of a low episode. I&#39;ve been feeling weak, as well as judgmental towards my need for rest; today, plank pose taught me that I am able to support myself. Thank you.",Andrea Nuñez,2021-02-10T13:10:01Z,332

Perhaps Adriene could do the session without a microphone but then in post production simple short audio cues could be inserted just to guide us. My wife and I loved your 30 day journey and look forward to many more!❤️,FlyinRickY,2021-02-09T22:50:22Z,2

"Man, all I can say is thank you, Adriene. Of all of your 30 day journeys, this is the one I feel I grew the most over the course of the 30 days. Not just physically (although I did find the bravery and ambition to add in a few more push-ups and stick with those core exercises a little bit longer 😋), but as we went along I found myself not just saying &quot;I am brave&quot; or &quot;I am worthy&quot; or &quot;I love myself&quot; but actually believing it. I was spending a lot more time checking in with myself physically, mentally, and emotionally. To my surprise, I ended up really finding that connection to center on day 18 that has stuck with me to the end. And, appropriate for the name Breath, this journey was where I really feel like my connection to my breath stuck with me through most of the practices. I don&#39;t know where the road will take me next, but I&#39;m excited to find out! Thank you again, Adriene. Here&#39;s to the next leg of the journey! 💚",Alex Harrell,2021-02-09T21:21:50Z,45

"I love every minute of Breath .... can you make training sessions over 75 minuters? I am doing True at the moment, two or three days in a row in one session.<br />Thank you for you and your Yoga, it is pure joy and relaxation.

"That You Adriene, I can&#39;t believe how strong I have become. I am on day 38 of yoga. I just finished your series and am so thankful for it. My dog, a Queensland practiced right along side me like Benji. You always make me smile. On February 1st I started a 30 day meditation challenge with your videos. So on day 9 of that. I will combine with yoga throughout February with your calendar and meditation. Namaste",Shelagh Sands,2021-02-09T19:44:03Z,0

"This was probably the most challenging and life changing 30 day yoga challenge of all but I am so glad I made it through with y&#39;all!  Around day 16, I fell down some stairs and hurt my knees, hip, and ankle. However, I didn&#39;t take a break, I pulled through. I couldn&#39;t follow the challenge at that point because I couldn&#39;t do the table top position. So, I just did my own little yoga sessions with things I was able to do without causing more pain. After a couple of days, I was able to continue the challenge. So, I technically finished this on day 37. Now, I feel the urge to continue the streak and see how far I can make it. I hope by sharing this some people feel encouraged to keep going even if life throws all kinds of things at you. Sometimes I had to do yoga just before bedtime because I was too busy all day and other days I had a hard time motivating myself. This is all part of a normal life but doing something for yourself should always be your priority no. 1!",Nate the Nomad,2021-02-09T19:08:58Z,0
"I made it! A litte late but I completed the Breath 30 Day. I loved the last day, cause I could prove to myself that I learned to follow my breath. An the end, I feel so sad but in the same way happy. Thank you Adrianne for this challenge. Namaste!🧘‍♀️",Lourdes Velazquez,2021-02-09T18:55:53Z,0

"Thank you, Adrienne, for a yoga-filled and wonderful final Breath practice. It was challenging without your always amusing, kind and clear dialogue, but satisfying to reach the conclusion. With more to come. Loved seeing Benji moving in and out of the shot like a fiddlers elbow. His downward dog is perfection! And of course a session wouldn’t be complete without some knocking on heaven’s door! Thank you for being so encouraging. Helps us oldies get to the mat daily. And thank you for being so sweet and kind. Namaste 🙏 🥰",Tim Benford,2021-02-09T17:48:39Z,1

"Thank you, Adriene, for this beautiful journey and for your guidance. At first, I was a little unsure about this freestyle yoga session, however, it felt really good after all. A few times, I was looking at the video and once to my surprise, I was doing the same pose as you by accident. The other times, I was looking for inspiration :D This last session was also really helpful in respect to perceiving this yoga as self care and me time instead of a challenge (and I really needed this as I sometimes get a little bit too competitive). Thank you very, very much again.<br /><br />I also want to thank a very dear friend of mine who introduced me to YWA. I think of her often at the end of a session. She is really great and maybe, she finds this comment after one of her practices. &lt;3",Joanna M.,2021-02-09T16:20:33Z,1

It felt really disappointing to get all this way, and then feel totally frustrated on the very last day. Wish Adriene would reconsider this tactic - maybe do two versions of the last day - one silent, and the other with minimal voice prompts so we can at least know when she is changing position.",alison hearn,2021-02-09T15:21:35Z,1

I did a half hour of my own practice (not 50 mins like your video) and started this journey a week late, but believe it or not, that kind of behavior is growth for me after years of food restriction and hour-a-day-minimum exercise requirements.

When i first started i think i felt really guilty that i started late and was really mean to myself about it but as the days and weeks went on i realized that i really dosen&#39;t matter when i started at all it is the fact that i took the time to show up everyday for 30 days😊<br />Lots of love, <br />Ammi❤️",Amarana Gersch,2021-02-09T09:38:00Z,17

I have a crick in my neck from straining to see when she would move next and I could not enjoy the rest poses as I had no idea when they would be over. I also stopped at one point and just marvelled at her grace and fluidity moving from one pose to the next. Having said that, I loved the whole series and will continue to follow and practice.

"This was one of the most special practices I&#39;ve ever did. I was caught surprised when you let us “find what feels good” and I thought I shouldn&#39;t do it because I didn&#39;t feel ready for this kind of yoga. But I dared to try, to blend with your music and sequence. <br />Firstly, it was real yoga. I did those asanas I knew and put myself into this completely. Although we were doing various asanas, I was really pleasant when I looked on the screen and saw you were doing the same exercise that me! This feels incredible for some reason, a gentle flow of our unification. <br />Secondly, when I did all of those dynamic moves, I started to perform the lighter ones. Lying on the back, noticing my breath, playing with my feets... Essentially, this act turned out to be fully meditative and my mind was like still water during this. I felt like the threads between me and my surroundings, things around me were synchronised and we were acting from the same natural way that lies at the foundation of everything. <br />Thirdly... After my meditation, my mind began to rise and bloom with colourful light. I felt waves of inspiration breezing on me, filling my imagination with creative energy like they easily flow into my mind. This was really important for me because I am a novice author and I am going to compose books, so this inspiration gave me answers and keys to the questions about my world building that bothered me for a long time. <br />I noted I became more flexible, tranquil, stronger... This day I could grab my toes in the those asana where we lie on the legs and reach for them but not curving them. Also, I paid attention I could get into the &quot;happy baby&quot; pose and feel completely comfortable in comparison that I couldn&#39;t do at the beginning...<br />...beginning. Each conclusion is another start. When I started, I was inexperienced and open for knowledge you offered, now I know a lot of exercises and have some experience at yoga. Essentially... I realised now I am at the new beginning of something even further, my personal practices and new attribute to yoga. Before I have always been doing it with your guidance and I felt incredible but today... With the freedom you shared with us, I composed something new, my own sequence. Today is the switch between those times. And I got &quot;each ending is another opening&quot; means we exist in continuous process of moving from one point of present into another one. <br />I greatly appreciate your journey you guided us through and cleared our minds for something greater up ahead. Thank You for Your gifts You gave us we will never forget and will always keep it in our hearts. Namaste. 💜💚",Clara Sirius,2021-02-08T17:36:24Z,0

Thank you so much Adrienne. <br /><br />Just a bit of feedback - the muted microphone didn’t work for me at all 🥺 I’m 17 minutes in and had to stop because I keep looking up at the screen and realizing I’m doing something entirely different. I can’t focus on my movements or my breath in the same way I could if I were able to hear the instruction. I’m going to try to do a “flow” all by myself, though, and integrate what I’ve learned. Thank you again!",Gaby B,2021-02-08T15:24:17Z,1

"Thank you Adriene ❤️ I’m autistic and often feel that I lack imagination and creativity, so I was feeling very apprehensive going into this final day, knowing that it would be unguided. But those 50 minutes flew by and I actually managed to do it! I looked at you a few times for guidance but I was happily surprised sometimes when I looked at you and saw that we were doing the same thing! Again thank you and I can’t wait to do more yoga with you and the rest of the community ☺️❤️",Abi Johnson,2021-02-08T12:55:08Z,0
"I finished the 30 days today 😢😍 i noticed how much i have improved! At first i tried to follow adriene to the dot, then i realized i needed and wanted to take my own time with the moves. Pausing the video and letting yourself improvise a bit, finding what feels good to you, felt really good and finding the confidence to do this is revolutionsl to me!!  So i think my practice was a bit longer than the actual video 😅💓<br /> I heard adriene&#39;s instructions still in my head: i am worthy, i am strong. I felt light as a feather, even though i still struggle with some poses. But im getting there💓 breathing had never been easier ❤️ thank you everyone, and have confidence in your breath, in yourself ❤️🌱",r_i_e_n_a _,2021-02-08T12:49:42Z,0

A true gift!🌿 The final session was a challenge for me, too insecure on relying on what I know and what feels good for me, but I know I&#39;m getting closer to really trusting myself and creating my own flow.

"9 days late, but I reached the end of this amazing 30-day journey. Thank you so much, Adriene, for producing this masterpiece. As I practised I felt the entire 30 days flash before me. It was magical. Love how <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwyEtS_7OQ&amp;t=22m37s"">22:37</a> Adriene spread the blanket to invite Benji back down while she was in the middle of a downward dog. That boy received so much love in this video as always. I lost myself in this practice and the music was incredible. The music starting at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwyEtS_7OQ&amp;t=41m16s"">41:16</a> resonates with me as it was played in the first-ever Yoga With Adriene video I watched back in 2018 from Day 10 of her 30 days of yoga series in 2015. I watched that video so many times before I ventured into others and was from then I became a fan. Finally at the end of the practice as I lay on the floor,r a big smile crept on my face as the soundtrack for this entire 30 days started to play. Adriene, you truly are a powerful woman. So creative! Thank you so much for all you do. Peace and love to you and Benji. Love you! 💖",Francis,2021-02-08T07:27:24Z,0

"For those of us who chose to try following along, or those who aren&#39;t comfortable doing so, perhaps there could be a hybrid version of Day 30 where just poses are called?  Or maybe no speaking but a gentle &#39;chime&#39; when the poses change?  EVERY Day 30 so far I&#39;ve hurt my neck trying to watch for the next transition, it makes for a miserable experience.  Bonus, this is hard for couples who try to do yoga together.",J K,2021-02-07T23:14:38Z,11

I have been exploring for a few years now with you Adriene from the days of Revolution all the way to Breath and all the videos in between, (it&#39;s been a few years). I don&#39;t have the words my darling to say exactly how I felt at the end of this practice, the nostalgia when I heard the themes from the practices over the years and the challenges I faced over the years whilst practicing with you til today. The theme from &#39;Home&#39; almost made me cry so I was already a bit tender, but when we got to the end, whilst lying in Shavasana, everything came pouring out, love joy, sorrow, pride all of it. Adriene, thank you, from my great soul to your great soul, thank you. This post was long but is goes a very tiny way to explain how grateful I am for you and the community..

"These comments are so uplifting and full of joy. I was a few days behind and a little hesitant to see the final days length, however the prior days really led us to the end.

"Adriene, I just wanted to let you know how much I have enjoyed following your yoga videos. You’re by far my fave teacher I found on youtube. I love your positive attitude and how you keep it real. You seem extremely knowledgeable and your instruction encourages me to practice ease. Every time I leave the mat after watching a video of yours I feel better, and i get a chuckle or two every time!

"it took me a few days to decide on doing this yoga challenge in the beginning of the year, so I&#39;ve been a few days behind each day for the past month, haha, but I think it actually helped me put less pressure on myself when it comes to being lenient with skipping days. That being said, I only rain checked two! I had no expectations for myself coming into this journey, but it has helped me in so many ways. first of all, helloooooo biceps!! who knew i even had those, haha. but in all seriousness, I&#39;ve been able to turn to my breath and focus internally with much more ease as a result of this past month. when I feel anxiety creeping around my heart i just take a deep breath, stand up taller, press into my feet and breathe and it has helped so much. looking forward to following the ywa calendar and seeing more of you each day:) -madi",M Wilson,2021-02-07T02:31:28Z,0

Thank you Adriene for being just who you are! Through songs and pain and tears 😭. And the greatest gift you have given is a way for us to forget this crazy ‘P’ world we are living in now.

"I started this on the first along side everyone else, and it’s was so amazing and beautiful. I missed a few days in between due to feel sick or exhausted, and even though I was two days behind I felt strong and amazing. Towards the end of the challenge I had to miss two more days and I felt devastated, I wanted to show up every day, I felt disappointed in myself. I came to finally finish the challenge today, and I knew the no mic was coming. I came with low mood, as I was sad to finish today and not when I initially intended, but as soon as it started I decided to do my own thing, only sometimes looking for inspiration. It was life changing. I’ve done the other challenges and always strained to follow Adriene, but today I just did what feels good. Looked at the clouds and blue skies, the flower in my yard, and breathe. I didn’t want it to end! I kept extending it. I felt powerful, and I knew I was meant to do this today. As I cried at the end I said out loud “ I am powerful. I am worthy. I accept where I am today and I am proud of myself. This challenge will be important to me for the rest of my life, and I can’t wait to do it again. Thank you adriene for this gift. I love you. I love joining everyone with this practice!

"I just finished Breath today and I’d like to share my deepest gratitude. I’ve always had a negative relationship with exercise and my body. I used it as a punishment, and so I’ve never been able to cultivate a regular routine or a good relationship with myself. I was always down on myself for not meeting a certain standard, not being strong enough, etc. And then a friend recommended YWA. Adriene, the way you carry yourself through this practice helped me see that working out or using my body was not a punishment, but a gift. You don’t TELL us to do things, you INVITE us. And those invitations showed me how to communicate with myself in a nurturing way. So when we got to corpse pose, I just started crying, because for the first time in my LIFE, I’ve been able to show up for my body every single day in a positive way, and watch myself become stronger without any other emotion other than LOVE for who I am and where I am on my journey. This was my first YWA 30 days, but tomorrow I start HOME. Because in many ways, I have finally found home within myself.",Natalia,2021-02-06T15:56:04Z,0
I’m staying with my mom for awhile due to the pandemic and we did the whole 30 day journey together. So special to share our thoughts and feelings about each practice over dinner and to feel the strengthening. I’m paying a LOT more attention to my breath these days. Thank you so much Adriene.

Going back to my breath, listening to my body, and using what I have learned in this program.  Hard to do but a worthy challenge.  I find myself moving more consciously this month, paying attention to where my body is and how it is working together and with my breath.  It has taken me slightly more than 30 days to finish...but I have kept coming back to the mat and feeling so pleased with myself when I did!

"I found this practice the most challenging of the month. I did it 6 days late, and nearly skipped it completely. I thought I&#39;d be lost without a guiding voice, and at times I was. I ended up going off the &quot;script&quot; and feeling my way through, with a stiff body and period pains to navigate. And by 30 minutes, I&#39;d exhausted myself by going through lots of positions (maybe) too quickly. So I just lay still for the last 20 minutes and focused on accepting my own journey and resting my tired body and mind. Very interesting experience! Thank you Adriene, for this, and for the whole 30-day experience. I&#39;ll certainly continue my practice with you as my guide &lt;3",Lucy S,2021-02-06T11:32:59Z,1
"Thank you so much for this journey. It&#39;s the first 30 day journey I followed almost everyday. I had some difficulty keeping up, because my job and life in general can be so exhausting and overwhelming, that it felt like my body wasn&#39;t capable to do anything more than to go to work on some days. And on other days, I learnt that yoga is the exact thing I need when I am exhausted. I want to be kind and mindful of what my body and my mind needs, and I am still learning what that means every day. But this journey truly brought me closer and I am really grateful to you Adriene &lt;3",Maebh Rabbitte,2021-02-06T11:28:46Z,1

"I´m sure nobody will read this, since I was a little late to this challenge; today was my last day. And I feel like I need to say how much of an emotional rollercoster this whole journey was. Especially today. <br /><br />When I heard I will do this on my own I felt so lost. And the music sounded so so sad. I thought I won´t make it. or at least not without crying half of the time. At this point I need to say that I have a huge problem with ending things; no matter what! Could be a video game too. So that was a surprise that I made it that far in first place.<br />Anyways. I felt lost at the beginning and tend to look up every few seconds. Than I heard Adrienes voice in my head from the other days and began to breath, relax and slowly find my rhythm. It was such a great feeling! And I can´t say how greatful I am to say: I´ve made it!<br /><br />But as I realized the familiar music in the end I began to tear up... man... I wish I could start again. I mean I can, but it´s time for the next journey. I defintley will stick a while longer here on this channel.

My goal, when I started this, was just to be able to prove to myself that I could be disciplined enough to finish this journey. How little I knew back then about how much more I would learn, feel, and embrace in these thirty days. I am so thankful. <br />It felt so affirming to put all the vocabulary and tools in place, and to trust myself to find what feels good and lean into it. <br />This community is so empowering, uplifting, raw, open, and honest , and I am so proud of everyone who made it here (even if it took a little longer than 30 days like it did for me!). <br />Sending you all love. &lt;3",Alana Dyer,2021-02-06T04:01:00Z,1

"I have seen several comments that are critical of this practice without the guidance of Adriene&#39;s voice, and I totally see where your fear and discomfort comes from. But I thought I would add a comment for those coming to this video for the first time who may be scared away by those comments. After doing the 30 days, I promise you are capable of doing this practice without her voice. She follows the same patterns that she has for the past 29 days, so you will certainly be able to follow her flow, only checking in every so often. It also feels so liberating and empowering to do what feels good for you too! It feels so good that I can do movements that feel good for me, then meet Adriene back in the next downward dog and continue back with her when I&#39;m ready. It takes trust in yourself to do this flow without her guidance, but if you honour the principles of the past month of moving from your center, trusting yourself, doing what feels good, etc., you will find value in this. For those feeling a bit lonely in this practice, I totally see that and you are valid, but I also think it&#39;s so nice to just simply do yoga along side her, rather than trying to copy what she does. I would put your laptop somewhere high, like a desk or bed, so you can easily look up and see her. I felt amazing after this, and you will too!",Robyn Christine,2021-02-06T01:03:59Z,7
I think it&#39;s telling that you assume people dislike this video out of fear. You can be several years into your yoga practice and still not be able to create your own flow on the fly. And if you can why would you even be using a YouTube video? Plenty of us had massive trouble with this video because we don&#39;t know what move comes next or how long we should be holding for and that&#39;s why we do youtube yoga videos in the first place.,Prosateuse,2021-02-08T03:27:06Z,0

"I found yoga during a very difficult time at home. Unfortunately it was not a safe space for me to lockdown, I wasn&#39;t leaving my bedroom just to avoid stress, it was hard. Yoga was the only thing I could do that that helped in my small space. During these 30 days I have moved to a happier home for now and will continue to take these mindsets with me. Most importantly the mindset and breath with me as well as the physical practise. Don&#39;t usually write things like this on social media but since it&#39;s an important day :) Well done everyone. Things aren&#39;t settled but &quot;I am where I&#39;m supposed to be&quot;",Hosanna .,2021-02-05T22:49:34Z,0
"Just finishing up a few days late.  I really didn’t enjoy the previous last day in the last 4 series.  I have been doing them since June, but I loved looking at the beautiful flow and each time I was less and less dependent on the instruction.  This one was very different, I hardly looked at all and made up my own dance (and falls) for almost all of the way through. And at 68 very proud of myself.  I have learned to be easy on myself for not always showing up, but I’ve come a long way!  Thank you Adriene and my son for getting me started!! OXOXOX",Carla Strand,2021-02-05T22:36:12Z,0

"We did it ya&#39;ll!! Thank you so much for this wonderful series, I started this new year with the goal of wanting to feel refreshed in the morning, no more &quot;scrolling through my phone the first thing when i wake up.&quot; so i started doing quick 10 min yoga sessions in the morning, but i was always lost when it came to the breath which i knew was a fundamental part of yoga. i didn&#39;t know that you made 30 day yoga series every year so i was pleasantly surprised to see that you created a series on breath for this year. learning how to control my breath (and the types of breath there are), has helped me tremendously! i&#39;ve used the techniques you&#39;ve shared to help get me through tough exercises, uncontrolled tremors, and i&#39;ve even warned my body up with them. <br /><br />besides the breath, im also really happy to say that ive felt myself getting stronger and my mobility has definitely gotten better. before breath, i was able to touch just my fingertips to the ground while doing forward fold, but i now can almost touch up to my palms on the ground! my calves have also started unlocking. i used to dread downward facing dog, but i dont anymore. my arms, back, core, legs....everything got better! again, thank you so much adriene!",Bryan D,2021-02-05T18:28:53Z,0

"Hey everyone! I see many people saying they felt uncomfortable needing to look all the time. I might be wrong, but I don’t think that was the point of this practice. I did my own practice, just going with how I wanted to move, but it felt great to feel that Adriene is right here ready to catch me. It’s the perfect way to give the last lesson, to let us feel how much we can do by ourselves. Not many teachers are willing to let their students go like that. I didn’t notice how I did 50 minutes all on my own intention. If you’re struggling following Adriene here, maybe looking at it from this point will help!

"I ended up missing practice for almost a week, and it would have been so easy to just stop altogether since I only had 2 days left to go, but I came back to the mat for my final day today. The length of this video was daunting, I&#39;ll admit, and even more daunting was finding out I wasn&#39;t getting any audio directions. But I&#39;m proud of myself! I made it through 35 minutes of guiding myself, just listening to the music and hardly looking at Adriene. I found my mind wandering more than usual without that guide there but I brought myself back to my breath and sometimes I could even hear Adriene&#39;s voice in my head. I never ever thought I would guide myself through a practice but I just did!! <br />It doesn&#39;t matter if you only practiced for 10 minutes, or for the full video, I&#39;m proud of you all for bringing yourselves to this and it&#39;s been so nice to have this journey alongside you all!! And thank you Adriene! This was the first 30 day challenge I managed to complete (I think I gave up on last years after 5 days), and I can&#39;t wait to share my journeys with this community!",Kathryn A,2021-02-05T00:59:31Z,0

"I’m a bit late to the game but I did it. You’ve done it again ❤️<br />This was the perfect way for me to get back into yoga after a pause. I found you over a year ago (whoa) and it’s an amazing journey. <br /><br />Now comes the time to go our separate ways and onto other yoga journeys, whether that’s with Adriene or someone else, but I think it’s amazing that we’re all connected through this journey. <br /><br />Also, I love how the final Breath video was titled “begin”",Bella_Loxy7,2021-02-05T00:10:31Z,0

"I would like to thank you and congratulate for this experince, Adriene! Must confess, I was skeptycal at the  beginning. First, I doubted myself: will I have the discipline to keep up with the challange? Then, I wondered if these short sessions can have a significant impact at all. Well, I am happy to tell, I was wrong ☺ I did keep up and I do feel the positive impact of the practice. And it is because you had built it up and structured so well! The whole experince with the videos, their duration, the emails, the inspiring messages was just perfect! I cannot praise you (and your team) enough. You are a wonderful teacher. Step by step I learned to trust the sequences, to trust you, and a bit also myself. So, here I am, facing another challange now: to contine with a daily practice with the Yoga with Adriene the whole year 😊 I am excited! So, thank you! Much love to you and all the yogis here! Reading the commenting section always gave me an extra boost! Namaste.",huthanna,2021-02-04T22:15:53Z,0
"I had started a 30 day yoga journey on another channel and it wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. So, on the fourth of January I circled back to the channel that started my home practice and WOW! It feels like I was guided to this journey at my time because even though I was four days behind each day of practice helped me thru this month. It&#39;s been such a pleasure practicing with everyone! Also, not sure if we were meant to follow along with this video, but I just found my own flow and it was equally as fulfilling.",diego,2021-02-04T22:11:48Z,0

This was a first for me doing yoga without being in a classroom and I loved it Adriene It’s great she’s such a good vibe.

Carving out a small amount of time for myself everyday to pause and share the space with you and everyone else on their yoga journey has changed my whole relationship with myself, my body and my mind.

"Thank you Adriene for an incredible journey! I am not usually one to take care of my mind and body, but as the pandemic wore on both, it felt more and more urgent and your 30 day journey came right on time. I was surprised how much I looked forward to it, and how much I learned about myself. This non-guided practice surprised me too, and though it was a real challenge and I was at a loss for actions every now and again, I did have some moments of flow and sweat and balance and peace. And you helped me do that! I love your guidance because I don&#39;t have a very logical brain so I can easily forget the parallels on each side or the tweaks, but damn, I just did 50 minutes of yoga &quot;by myself&quot; -- kinda ;) love this community. thank you all.",Carmen Hermo,2021-02-04T18:58:55Z,0

Thank you.",Bri Hodgkins,2021-02-04T18:17:55Z,0
"Thank you Adriene for prompting me to realize that I know much more than I sometimes think I do. I  was surprised at how the simple reminder to myself of &quot;breathe in, breathe out&quot; was most constant as I practiced, more than body cues, and that that was all I needed to keep moving. The movements sort of happened on their own. My other reminder to myself, during the second half, was &quot;I&#39;m strong.&quot; I needed those reminders today, and every day. I&#39;ve never done a daily yoga practice but I&#39;ve known deeply that it would be nourishing. I am going to use this inspiration, along with the strength and commitment I experienced this month, as fuel to continue to begin again each day. It&#39;s been good Adriene, very good.

"It&#39;s been a few days since I finished this journey. I loved this last day. The last months and especially January were not easy for me, and as I used to love my own practice, this last months I really needed your guidance. I picked a video every day since October. It felt very comforting to be guided by your voice. This last day of the journey, I was able to make my own movements again. You taught me so much this 30 days. Sometimes I peeked at the screen and saw you were doing the same, a few seconds before or after me, which felt like we were doing a dance, haha. I really loved the music, it helped me to get in my body and in the flow. Peeking at you, seeing you doing your own practice, gave a great unity feeling. Also realizing the fact a few 100 or 1000 other yogi&#39;s practicing along with me.<br />Adriene and all my fellow yogi&#39;s, thank you so much for this Wonderfull journey.

The FWFG practice for me is very much about being listening being led by the calm, consistency and flow of this. The screen is there to refer to but otherwise looking out of the corner of my eye is a strain, not the case when just following your voice as primary &#39;lead&#39;.

"I was a couple of days behind with this one, but just like the every Day 30, I found myself really emotional, especially at the end when I couldn&#39;t help but tear up a bit... Thank you so much, Adriene for this amazing series and for being such a great guide. I actually was able to go at my own pace and do my whole routine by myself, which isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve been able to do before! I found what felt good! <br /><br />In the last minutes, I just laid on the mat, thinking how grateful I am for this journey and frankly, how proud I am of myself for accomplishing this. This last year has been really challenging, as it has for many.. But this whole experience was like a life coaching seminar, and I feel hopeful and invigorated for whatever beginning comes next!

Wow!! I turned of the screen and just litsened to the music and followed my breath. I thought I was done after 20 minutes but it turned out I said namaste exactly the same time as Adriene did. So alined. Thank you fot this journey!,Linnea Svensson,2021-02-04T08:15:23Z,0
"Thanks so much Adrienne! I left this one a few a days as I wanted to make sure I had enough time, but still did yoga almost every day before work :) I feel like I&#39;ve finally built the habit now and I am so grateful. I actually really enjoyed this and found my breath was able to take me to each next move just as you said. Lots of love to you and of course the fabulous community on here.",Cait O,2021-02-04T08:00:23Z,0

"Last March when the UK went into lockdown I started ‘Home’ (how apt!) and really struggled with day 30. I didn’t know what pose I was meant to be doing next, how I should transition, couldn’t see the screen. I cried and felt useless. I carried on with YWA for the next year and today completing Breath I found my own flow, caught up with Adriene in some poses, changed for my own direction for others. I finally believed that I could do it. Thank you Adriene for this gift 💗 namaste",kate yiannacou,2021-02-04T07:59:41Z,0
Thank you so much for this incredible yoga journey Adrienne. I’m a few days late finishing as I had a long weekend break with no Internet access. I tried to follow some of what you were doing but would suggest you add a recording of minimal cues because it would be amazing to follow the class all the way through as it’s a really good recap of what we’ve done in the last 30 days. The music is lovely too.,Julia Stanton,2021-02-04T07:52:51Z,0

I feel &quot;here&quot; in my body, and many physical pains have mitigated, but my mental space feels clean. Like renewed. I did it and I wasn&#39;t alone, and all the way I felt so loved.

"I finished my &quot;30 days&quot; today, February 3rd. It was an honor to do this class and really connect with breath, myself, and feel a part of something special, good, and healthy shared with stranger friends from around the world. As I did the last class with Adriene, I heard her voice in my head: &quot;root to rise&quot;, &quot;breathe love in, breathe love out&quot;, and &quot;find what feels good&quot; at different moments. I followed Adriene and did some of my own thing too. My crow didn&#39;t get off  the ground, but felt strong and with more of my body engaged than in the last 30 plus years of practice. I&#39;ve worked with a lot of yoga teachers and learned something from every one, but Adriene is my favorite, this lifetime, so far.

"Really smiling at the end of this. First 30 day challenge I have never guided myself through any amount of yoga before. I went through a range of experiences from “wow this is amazing” to omg I can’t think of anything else, checking the time stamp and contemplating ending early. Sometimes I joined with you Adrienne and some I did my own thing (TRUST). In the end (a few days late) it was a beautiful and valuable experience and I thank you and everyone on this journey with me 😌🙏🏻🧘🏼‍♀️",Elyse,2021-02-04T05:02:59Z,0

I&#39;ve had a hard time being okay with silence and my own thoughts. Adrienne, this practice has helped me to feel a bit in control again. It has helped me to trust myself again.

Good practice but it was impossible to follow and I had to stop half way through and find something else. I couldn&#39;t relax or find my breath because I was constantly looking at the screen.

"I was disappointed with Day 30. My husband and myself have followed through faithfully the last 29 days, day 30 was too much, looking up at the screen and trying to figure out what to do,  no verbal guidance. I don&#39;t know my left from my right so a little verbal encouragement would have been helpful! We did not complete the last 30 day practice because we got lost.  It makes me very sad, I have challenged and persuaded my husband to do this daily and am super disappointed in the last show off routine. .",Lorna Murphy,2021-02-03T23:07:28Z,1

"I am not gonna lie, it was not an easy final chapter for me as I found it difficult to practice just on my own for 50 minutes. For half of the time, I kept peeking at the screen, hurting my neck, forgetting about my breath and then.... I just decided to screw it and let it flow. Let my breath guide me to find what feels good as I remembered that was the purpose. And that&#39;s when I started to fully appreciate this practice. Yes, it was challenging. But it also made me feel incredibly empowered because I felt like I truly knew what I was doing - simply building on everything the last year with Adrienne and this 30 days journey taught me.

Day 30 was a disappointment as I was really looking forward to a full guided session. Watching your practice was beautiful and on it&#39;s own inspirational.

"I came here today so eager to peacefully finish off my beautiful 30 days of yoga, but being my first time doing a 30 days, I didn&#39;t know the last day is not a guided one. After 10 min I stopped, finding it really frustrating to keep peeking at the screen. We all know the sequences, but after one it&#39;s done, what next? Getting used to a certain way of practice for 29 days and then bam, it&#39;s different in the very last day it just made me uncomfortable. What is the point of having this marvellous teacher if she doesn&#39;t guide you? I guess I&#39;m a creature of habit and will find the answer after a few more 30 days journeys with Adriene. Thank you for the amazing 29 days. &lt;3",Livia Trif,2021-02-03T17:06:43Z,1
Holy leg baby. SO emotional today. The intro music to all the 30 Days got me. I kept seeing the seven past “me”s on their journeys trying to figure it out. In shavasana when I heard the Breathe music I saw us all lay down into our body and I said “I don’t know either girls but I love you”. Felt so damn good. Can’t thank you enough Adriene and community. ♥️,Chelsea Wullenweber,2021-02-03T16:55:26Z,0
"I delayed this practice because I wanted to do it the right way, not rushing. It was worth it, I cried a little when you vowed Adriene, because I don&#39;t feel that great at this, I can&#39;t even do the forward fold! But still you think we are all great and worthy, and I believe I need to see more of that in myself. Always a challenge to go without guidance, to listen not to your confident voice but to our doubtful minds and bodies, to find what feels good for us, for as many breathes as we need not as you cue... a very humbling and powerful experience. Love you!! I&#39;ll catch up in bridge everyone!!",mariana campos,2021-02-03T16:34:29Z,0
This was my first 30 Day Challenge with Adrienne and I loved it. I showed up faithfully each day and completed each practice. Until Day 30. When Adrienne said she wasn’t going to talk I started doubting myself and quit 15 minutes into it. It took me 2 more days of reminding myself to breathe and that I could do I! And I did. My own version and it was good. Thank you Adrienne for this gift. I am continuing with the next 30 days! 💕🙏🏼,Wendy Crowley,2021-02-03T16:28:09Z,0
A HUGE thank you to Team Yoga With Adriene/BREATH- A 30 Day Yoga Journey! I am so much stronger and more confident than when I began on Day 1. I have had to modify/do what I can and have been thrilled to see/experience my progress. My body feels better than it has in many year. Lots of Love to you all and deep gratitude.

"Today is a celebratory day because it means we reached day 30. I have never quite come to the end of one of the 30-day practices, and this was the first time I&#39;ve ever done a yoga practice unguided. However, I found to be quite simple to let my body find what felt good and the time flew by. How freeing, how peaceful, how rewarding. &lt;3 I look forward to continuing to grow my yoga practice each day I am given breath.

Thanks Adriene for trusting in our abilities to practice on our own. It was definitely an emotional one. I really needed this and I&#39;m sure a lot of people did too. I know from my own experience that trusting in myself is something I&#39;ve been struggling with A LOT. It&#39;s nice that you provided the space for me and everyone to do so.

"When you said you would take off your mic, I was afraid. I did not now how I would practice by myself. But with you their as a guide, I started my practice by saying &quot;hello my darling friend&quot; to myself, and everything went smoothly from there. I practiced as the sunrise fell on my face and watched the squirrels outside playing with each other, grateful for my breath. Thank you for this wonderful journey, Adriene. I am two days late, but I have finished. Or as you said, only just begun. &lt;3",Fatima Naveed,2021-02-03T13:38:40Z,0

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adriene almost daily since the start of the pandemic and this has got me through some difficult moments. I&#39;ve just finished the Breath series and on this last one I was suffering from a UTI, did the first 5mins with a hot water bottle on my lap and didn&#39;t think I can do it till the end but kept telling myself I can do this, I am strong! I did the whole video in my own pace and honestly feel much better, felt like a little victory! What a journey!

"Thank you Adriene for another wonderful and transformative 30 days. I was hesitant about doing 50 minutes of unguided yoga, unsure if I&#39;d be able to fill the time. But by the end of the video I still wanted to keep going, and ended up in a nice comfortable seat, feeling the gentle breeze on my skin, listening to the birds outside, and remaining cognisant of my breath. This is the third 30 day yoga journey that I&#39;ve done, and for me the most impactful. I feel like I have relearned how to breathe, and learned tools to align my body and mind.

And although I was mostly doing my own thing and only sometimes looked up and then did something you were doing, I had a beautiful relaxing practice, feeling like I stretched myself and it was exactly right. It had this flow to it that I wasn’t expecting. Beautiful. I felt really proud to have done this for 30 days in a row even though it took me a day or two to figure out when was the right time of the day to do it. <br />Overall I loved the focus on breathing and slowing down.",Benita Loff,2021-02-03T10:58:26Z,0

"Adriene, thank you so much! <br />I did the 30 day challenge last year and it got me into doing yoga (almost) everyday for the whole year. Before that experience I never new what a difference it makes to practice daily instead for longer sessions once or twice a week. And how much easier :-) and way more transformative for body and mind it is! <br />Last year on day 30 I followed your every move and was so proud to do that without your voice. <br />This year I am even more proud and touched because I flowed freely, found what feels good (a little tree dance for example) and only glanced at you doing yoga beside me from time to time. <br />I think this is the part of your work I am most thankful for, that you teach how to feel and enable others to do yoga or any other movement on their own according to their own needs. <br />And what a cool thing to practice alongside so many people from all over the world. <br />Love from Germany, A",Blauschwalbe,2021-02-03T09:05:05Z,0

I do the whole month and then I can’t do the final video, which is usually the best one! PLEASE, Adrienne, consider doing it with cues in the future. Many of us can’t even do the last day because of this and it sucks to get all the way to end and not be able to enjoy the grand finale.  Thank you 🙏🏼",Angela Topcu,2021-02-03T06:08:30Z,1

I decided to turn off the screen and just kept the music of the video (knowing that Adriene was with me) and at the end i was very surprised, because I did not see the time passed ! Really ! I was like, omg i did 1 hour of yoga ? Alone ? Wow ! I had the energy today, a lot of my mind so..i put it all back and came to the mat. So happy !

"Thanks Adriene you have given us so much and so many tools to work with.  I admittedly felt a little frustrated in this last class b/c I had a very hard time following along  in my living room (aka &quot;gym&quot;) without your voice guiding me.  I have learned, through your guidance, to trust enough to just listen to your voice and not necessarily watch you, but this time I had to keep twisting my head to see and felt like I was scrambling the whole time.  Despite that, I have extremely enjoyed all of your kind, gentle guidance and cueing and while I could often hear your voice in my head telling me to breathe and relax and to let go of that which doesn&#39;t serve you,  I&#39;ll admit that especially in the resting poses, I kept popping up to look - &quot;what are we doing now&quot; loll  Thanks for spoiling us and giving us your gifts of guidance so graciously throughout these 30 days.  Much love to you and Benji!",Tracy B,2021-02-03T03:50:38Z,1

"I am a bit late adding my comment, but just wanted to thank you Adriene for this 30 day journey. I have followed along each day and found myself gently challenged and encouraged. I am still not able to get my feet off the ground for the crow pose and I suspect it might be some time yet before I do! But while I still sometimes lose my balance, I feel stronger, calmer and a real sense of accomplishment to have followed this through. This final session is always a challenge for me as I find your voice guidance during the class so beneficial to keeping my flow. I understand that it&#39;s to help us begin to see we can guide our own session or journey, however at this stage in my yoga journey I miss the vocal guidance. BUT, I was pleased to learn that I have grown on my journey and was able to lead myself along for a good while before having to resort to peeking for inspiration! Throughout the practice I could actually hear in my head little phrases you use, most of all &#39;remember to breathe&#39;! I genuinely felt quite emotional when the closing music began as this has been such a great comfort and inspiration at a challenging time for us all. It has given me structure and focus...and time to breathe.

Whoa! I finished my first 30 days yoga journey with Adriene. And I loved it! I did panic when you first said I am going to switch off my microphone. There were times I trusted myself entirely but times I had to turn and look at you. But I found myself repeating the vocabulary you have taught us and definitely focussing on my breath. It was beautiful to hear my breath and the music in the background sometimes in sync and sometimes not. But that’s ok. You have given me so much. I am so grateful and thankful to you. Of course Benji stole the show as usual 😀,Uma Novy,2021-02-03T01:04:30Z,1
"Very much enjoyed the music and the flow; yet, would have preferred some prompts as I had to keep looking at my screen to know what was next.  This practice has been wonderful and I will continue to follow YWA.  Thank you.",Estella Hill,2021-02-03T01:02:37Z,14
Adriene you haven&#39;t changed a bit. You look the same you did 6 years ago. I have been following 30 days yoga which you posted 6 years ago. Thanks for teaching us for free.,Anvesh chennupati,2021-02-03T01:01:29Z,23

"I had to skeep two days before actually getting to day 30, but it only made it more special. After a busy work day I found myself craving for a practice to celebrate feeling good with myself. And voilá, the traditional silent practice. It was really special to manage do guide my own practice with the repertory the YWA has given me. Thank you for the jorney!!!",Luiza Gullino,2021-02-03T00:05:08Z,1
"Forgot to comment when I actually finished, oops! ☺ Thank you so much for this Adriene. This journey has made what would otherwise have been a fairly miserable and stressful January so much better. It was something to look forward to and reflect on each day and benefitted me hugely. I&#39;m going on to Home tomorrow. Thank you for helping me kick off the year the right way! 😊",ClarIs,2021-02-03T00:04:40Z,0

"Day 30 is the best. My intention is to continue with February&#39;s calendar, but incorporate some self-guided days. So empowering and therapeutic. We truly do have the vocabulary. I found myself going back to breathing techniques we learned, doing vinyasa flows and familiar poses. I&#39;d stop and do lion&#39;s breath when I felt I needed to let go of something. Or horse breath. I found I used ocean breath when I needed some self-love and centering. Thank you for guiding us and empowering us, Adriene. Thank you fellow yogis. I feel the collective energy behind this. &lt;3",Devan Fronk,2021-02-03T00:01:01Z,0
I&#39;m a longtime YWA yogi just finishing up day 30 and OMG I loved that it cycled through music used in previous years! The music reminded me of how important YWA has been to me for the last 6 years. As usual.....it was another incredible new year journey!,Amanda Anderson,2021-02-02T23:57:32Z,0

"oh my god, I finally felt it. the last times I did your 30 day journeys I felt so lost at day 30 lol. I was constantly looking what you were doing and pressured myself to do a proper practice. but today, after 6 month of daily practice, I let go and let my body do whatever she needed. it was such a magical experience, thank you Adriene! Craziest thing is, I never thought I&#39;d practice for 50 minutes today, but when I said my &quot;namaste&quot; at the end, the video/music stopped at this exact moment and I was like &quot;whoa&quot;. Great experience! I feel al lot more like myself lately, on and off the mat. love it! on to the next 30! 🙏❤️",Gesa Meyer,2021-02-02T23:24:52Z,0

"this is the first 30 day challenge I&#39;ve ever completed and while on the journey I noticed that I was able to finish it because I loved what I was doing. I discovered a passion that I didn&#39;t know I had. This daily practice has taught me that I don&#39;t need to push myself to soreness everyday to feel stronger the next. It has taught me that fitness and leading a healthy lifestyle isn&#39;t about doing extremely difficult workouts everyday and that instead, it can be something enjoyable and relaxing. I&#39;m really proud of myself and anyone who has completed this journey!!

"We did it!! After all the horrible events that happened in the past year, this year’s 30 day yoga journey feels like a precious gift. This time one year ago I was so panicked and the events in this world had me feeling as if the rug had been ripped out from under me. If only I could tell that former self about today! One year later and there is some sort end in sight to this deadly pandemic, love and integrity have prevailed on the world’s stage, and people are still coming together to practice yoga here on our special little corner of YouTube. Again, what a gift this has been. It has been an honor practicing with all of you all around the world! Wishing you all love peace and happiness in 2021❤️🌎🧘🏽‍♀️",Kelsey Kearney,2021-02-02T22:36:25Z,0

I must admit I don’t love the last day, for a couple or reasons but mostly because I’m not confident in knowing what to do. But maybe in time that will chance.

"Two days later but I made it!!!!!!!!! I didn&#39;t think I could fill up 50 minutes, but I actually managed and got into shavasana at the same time as Adriene :) This year, I went completely off the beaten path, tried things I haven&#39;t tried by myself before, and I loved every minute of it. Makes you really think you CAN do it :) So proud of everyone who&#39;s done the 30 days, in these crazy times, we did something for ourselves and I feel that we are all united in that.

This physical practice definitely has always prepared me bodily and mentally to allow for my continuous healing. Grateful for your encouragement, I have reconnected with my BREATH—amidst caring for my 11-mo old baby who has yet to sleep through the night—and I missed it! So helpful for my sleep, or lack thereof! Many thanks!",Da,2021-02-02T21:30:00Z,0

After some sessions with you and Benji I now think of yoga as art: Even pain, even the worst of days, can be turned into a beautiful journey. You are a great teacher and a healer, because I believe you haven’t let your ego take over. You seem to be in touch with the divine without ever losing touch with your humanity. So, thank you for this, thank you for sharing. Namaste.",MoonageZero,2021-02-02T21:24:12Z,0

"What can I say - thank you so much Adriene - this has ben first for me - a first to do 30 days in a row committing to it without stopping. On the 2nd Jan I listened to someone say - do yoga three times a week and you will feel the benefit, do it every day and it will change your life. I remember doing onw of your classes a night a couldn&#39;t sleep and so I looked you up again and was so happy to find this. Its been incredible. What makes it so lovely is you. You have this beautiful gentle way about you with the lovely wicked streak of humour - thank you I have enjoyed every day with you and I feel calmer than I ever have in years and as I work and homeschool my son still - its helped me, us so much.

"I usually dont feel very much like commenting, but today I wanted to share: this whole practise from the beginning to the end felt very poetic to me. I was (and am) also emotional and cried, and it felt so so good. And by the end, when in shawasana, I felt like my body was a wide green field, with hills and grass and field flowers and all that, and I was watching the sunrise. Completely mesmerized.

But something magical happened tonight ✨ <br />I began the video with an open mind and to be honest, I didn&#39;t think I would complete it. But then,  I suddenly found myself truly tuning into my breath and with Adriene&#39;s words in my head, trusting that I would have the ability to &quot;go off the rail road tracks&quot; and do my own thing. I did and I was so shocked to see the video was almost over. Maybe it&#39;s third year lucky or maybe it&#39;s my yoga practice finally coming together.

"Today I made it to day 30! And I cried a little. Thank you Adriene for trusting me to be able to follow your moves without the guidance of your voice. All the body awareness you teached in this challenge suddenly came to bloom. I moved more graceful then ever before. Because I didn&#39;t have to listen and think, I suddenly felt my body move and it was amazing. Supple, strong and in sync. Thank you so much for this beautiful practice!",Bertine P.,2021-02-02T17:53:32Z,1
This was my first time heading to the end without any exceptions; I did only with the will of my Breath❤️ thank you so so much dear Adriene. You brought me a new sensation within myself. Found myself thinking I should more and more do yoga and let my thoughts come and flow during the time on the yogamat.  I feel grateful to be part of this journey 😍 wish we could meet again so soon!,Sule Ozer,2021-02-02T17:49:47Z,0

"I loved the grace of this beautiful practice and how Adriene wove many of the postures and movements she has shown us together into a final dance.  I am new to yoga and understand that it is a journey --that although at this stage I can&#39;t reach a number of the movements, I can move towards them.  I can&#39;t think of a more beautiful way to begin than with BREATH.  Thank you and Namaste!",Susan Beaumont,2021-02-02T17:47:01Z,0
"Loved this final practice (just finishing today). Thank you Adriene for the guidance and faith in us to navigate the routine ourselves, without step by step cues. So liberating, and a great reminder of how much I know and how capable I am. <br /><br />About 1/2 way through I went a little rogue and “found what felt good” to me. Then 3/4 through, my husband was done, so he picked up the mic and guided me verbally based on what Adriene was doing. 😆 <br /><br />We had fun with this video, so thank you again!! 🙏🏻",Jennifer Halverson,2021-02-02T17:36:27Z,0

"I absolutely loved this month Adriene, thank you! I&#39;ve done a few 30 day series with you now and have loved each one! I have to say I struggle with Day 30 of each though... Maybe I&#39;m missing the intent here, but I don&#39;t get into the flow like I do with the regular classes where I can just close my eyes and listen for your cues. With this one I&#39;m craning my neck every 10 seconds to see where you&#39;re at and what you&#39;re doing so that I may keep up and get the most out of the order of things. I would prefer an audio only class vs visual only for the last one. Unless of course it was something we worked towards, like a specific practiced or memorized flow, where we&#39;re just doing it side by side. The mic-off instruction doesn&#39;t make sense to me. BUT, I loved Days 1-29! Thank you for being our wonderful, funny, and gentle guide this past month.",Annie Herz,2021-02-02T17:28:05Z,2

It was just so overwhelming I couldn&#39;t help it. But then I started to hear your voice in my head and you guided me through the whole practice :). I cannot believe it&#39;s already the end of this journey.. Time flies really fast.. It was really incredible.

"adriene, that  was the sweetest, most magical experience i have ever had with yoga. I followed my breath, had minimal thoughts, took cues from you, found my inner smile, kept it simple and got out of my head with knocking on heaven&#39;s door, found myself bowing as you were bowing, found myself looking at you when you were looking at me. It was strangely connected, and absolutely wonderful. It seems you&#39;ve taught me alot, and I learned and grew in myself and my practice as a result.

If you had told me at the beginning that I would have ended up being able to do an hour of listening to myself and letting my body take me where it needed to be, I never would have believed you. The daily yoga practice and focus in on my breath has really brought a sense of control to my life and faith in my strength both on and off the mat that I definitely felt I was missing. I am so grateful for the journey and your soothing and nurturing guidance along the way Adriene! I can&#39;t wait to continue my relationship with daily yoga practice! &lt;3",Frances Desforges,2021-02-02T15:47:35Z,0
This practice was the most meaningful one by far. The music you chose added to the atmosphere. I realized that I know much more than I give myself credit for. I just need to trust myself and believe in myself a little more. I am truly capable of everything I set my mind to. I can&#39;t believe that I just practiced for 33 minutes by myself (had to cut it shorter because there&#39;s an amazing sunset outside and I don&#39;t wanna miss it)!

I have always struggled with the last day with no voice just flow. But this time I managed to go with the flow and it was beautiful.

I&#39;ve been able to keep my yoga schedule mostly consistent with the uploads but I waited on this one. The thought of doing it without any vocal guidance kinda intimidated me. But it snowed here in CT last night and I had a fire going so I decided it was time. I still tried to follow along with the video for the most part but there were times when I guided myself... after our 29 days of practice some of it started to stick. And staring out into the swirling snow in the quiet of night seemed like just the right moment  I had been waiting for where &quot;everything was just as it should be&quot;.<br />Thank you Adriene for sharing with us this special practice ❤ 💕,Ross Tiffen,2021-02-02T15:09:07Z,0

Thank you Adriene (and Benji)!!! My husband and I loved the 30 day challenge. It was so great for us to do it together every day. It&#39;s taken me YEARS to get him to do yoga with me. Adriene gave him the confidence. And it was a new beginning for me too as I had not been practicing regularly for several years. It was lovely to think of the thousands of others doing the practice along with us. Our dogs joined in every day adding some hilarity to the situation.

"Thank you so much for such an amazing yoga journey. I&#39;ve learned a lot along the way; being present, finding strength, and the meaning of &quot;It&#39;s not about what you do, but how you do it&quot;.<br />I will defiantly try to keep doing yoga. Also the tightness around my shoulders has been gone since first week, so that amazing. But I must admit that this last practice was quite a challenge for me, because of the missing introductions. Usually I will just close my eyes and follow your voice, so I can let everything out, and just do the patrice. But this time I would have to look at my computer all the time, otherwise I would be to steps behind. That was quite a challenge, especially in downward facing dog!

There were times you danced like a ballerina and I felt like an awkward student at their first dance.  But then I’d catch the wave and dance in sync and it felt awesome!

Hard to describe, please dont think I am mad !<br />I have never considered myself especially talented or creative, I cant dance, paint draw play a musical instrument. but what happened here was remarkable.  I found myself just wanting to flow with the music, incorporating the yoga moves, kind of following what you were doing, but just going with my body, I was a ballet/latin/indie/tai chi dancer, just interpreting the music and expressing through movement what has happened in my life, what is happening in my life, gratitude for all that I have  .    I was certainly curious today, I found something I did not know was there.   Thank you for all that you have taught me for the past 7 years.

"Oh gosh! As I started this video I thought, in quick succession, <br />&quot;I don&#39;t have time for this.. I&#39;ll just do part.&quot;<br />&quot;I will always look back and either know I did it, or I didn&#39;t do it. I&#39;d prefer to know I did it.&quot;<br />&quot;If I don&#39;t do this now, doing a 50 minute yoga session will become an additional thing on my to do list.&quot;<br /><br />I did the whole thing.<br /><br />It was very interesting to have no talking. I enjoyed being able to follow my breath better by not having to think about the vocal directions and incorporate them in. I did lose my breath as I was wrapped up in my family&#39;s recent judgments about my four year old (and I suppose my parenting). But I .. feel like the yoga and movement worked me through it? By the end I reached the conclusion (for now), that judgment is ignorance, and the antithesis (I believe I heard a monk once say), is observation. And I am upset because I feel judgements direct behaviours and become self-fulfilling-prophecies, however, I can still sift through people&#39;s judgements for any true observations, and take those and TRY to leave the rest behind / try not to engage. <br /><br />That thought cyclone, I feel, would have been a lot more painful and effortful if I hadn&#39;t been doing yoga at the time. I look forward to signing up for the next 30 day challenge. And will be adding instructionless yoga to me, &#39;things to do while pondering issues&#39; list!",Nicole Nasvytis,2021-02-02T11:26:52Z,0

Playing catch up and was about to do this after an abs class and day 29 but thought I&#39;d check length and comments. Am already tearing up! Think I&#39;ll wait until this evening. It occurred to me that when this day is done I will have actually completed something and that&#39;s a big achievement for me.

"Thank you Adriene for not losing faith in me &lt;3 This one was a LONG one and while i began strong doing what my body wanted, i had some moments of stillness in which i wasnt sure what to do next. But i think it was good to have that much time, to really practice listening. by the end i was doing back things and looked up to see you were in your final namaste bow! Namaste to you for bringing us all the gift of accessible yoga practice and ultimately listening to our bodies and calming our spirits. &lt;3",Ruby,2021-02-02T09:33:00Z,0

I never would have thought leading my own yoga routine would make me feel so good. I feel like I’ve committed to something and today was when I proved that I really learned. Being able to be able to lead myself for such a long time makes me feel like I’ve really done something worth doing that’s made me a better person. Then I also just didn’t realize how nice it is to not have to think about anyone”s voice but my own in my head. I feel  refreshed and calm in a way I never thought I would have from doing this 30 day yoga challenge. I hope everyone else has gotten some type of fulfillment from this experience like I have and I look forward to doing this all with you in 2022.,Mo O'Rourke,2021-02-02T07:05:05Z,0

Realizing how much I have learned, how much I have taught myself, and how much I have grown over these past few transformative months for myself. I loved the freedom of listening to what my body and soul wanted with each movement, and I could catch myself in so many poses correcting myself &quot;pull the left hip crease back&quot; &quot;square the hips&quot; &quot;inhale lots of love in, exhale lots of love out&quot; &quot;relax the skin of the face&quot;.

"I mean... What a journey!! I&#39;m so proud of you beautiful peoples of the YWA community. Also, I&#39;m really proud of myself. And not because I sucedeed to finally do the crow (still can&#39;t after 7 years of yoga practice, it&#39;s incredible this posture, it hurts to the knees and the armpitch so bad, I just can&#39;t). No, I&#39;m proud because this year marks my 4th time doing a YWA journey, but it is the first year that I do it entirely. One video per day every single day. And I understood how much it is important to do it like that. The change in my internal system (not just the physical body the whole thing) is so remarkable!

I got through 30 minutes or so and found when I peeked at the screen I had gone through the same moves.  I enjoyed the music and my breath, of course, to end this special journey.  Thank you so much Adriene for all that you do and for everyone supporting each other everyday. Hasta manana!❤️💕",Ann Marie Mahaney,2021-02-02T00:11:03Z,0
Thank you Adriene for a great start to 2021. I’m feeling stronger and more disciplined. I have saved my favourites from this series and will continue to do them for February. Namaste. 🙏🏽❤️😘,Samantha Earle,2021-02-02T00:10:41Z,0
It was more difficult for me without your voice leading me through...especially trying to get the breath in a good rhythm. So every once in awhile I would just stop and breathe and then see which pose you were doing next! I hope to try some of the February calendar!,Deb Brown,2021-02-02T00:04:43Z,2
"I kept up right till the end! Sometimes went to slow, and sometimes to fast, what an amazing experience! I feel so, I don’t know what word to use, I guess ‘released’.. Thank you so so much! Thank you for such a beautiful gift. 🙏 Namaste ❤️",majorissues1able,2021-02-02T00:03:34Z,0
"Did anyone else feel as though the practise did not feel like 50 minutes at all? Felt like only 20 minutes went by.. I’m blown away by how much stronger and longer my endurance has become, it felt so effortless. What a pleasantly surprising place to be, I hope everyone else is feeling a sense of accomplishment as well! See you on the mat again soon, namaste 🙏",Dominique Barbeau,2021-02-01T23:53:38Z,0

"To be honest, I almost didn&#39;t do it today. It was a long practice and I was really tired from the day, it&#39;s been raining for 2 full days (which is weird here in the summer) some places are flooded and I had to go to the office. But I did it and I&#39;m lowkey amazed. I got through all the practice without falling like a sack of potatoes, when at the start I could barely hold a plank pose with my muscles all weak and unused after my breast reduction surgery.<br />But I did it and I can o ly thank you, Adriene, because the entire month was absolutely perfect. It was the perfect sequence to get me back on track to being active, to get me in control of my own body and trust myself again that I can do more. You and your kindness made me be kind to myself and I will forever be grateful that you exist.",PolliitoAle,2021-02-01T23:45:54Z,0

"Oh Adriene thank you so much for this wonderful resource that you have created i am super grateful for your guidance. I first found your channel back in 2015 and I was a yoga wannabe but I only motivated myself to do maybe a couple of sessions a year. Then in later years I&#39;ve attended a few classes irl, did your video here and there but it kind of wasn&#39;t sticking or wasn&#39;t regular and then I stopped altogether. I then got a desk job in 2019 and my back was gradually getting more and more painful. I knew I had to do something so last spring I started doing some basic stretches  for 15min each morning and that already helped. Then I finally did some therapy and ayahuasca which I think helped release some old patterns and helped Reconnect back with my body and since then I&#39;ve been able to stick to a daily practice! I&#39;ve switched from my basic stretches to your videos daily back in mid November and km on it since. Might have skipped a day here or there but not frequently. I just completed your 30 day challenge (seemed unachievable even a year ago) and I think I find comfort in a daily practice now and made it a habit, I hope. I also find a lot of comfort in hearing your guiding voice and having your gentle presence on screen (love your random singing too). So thank you so much again because my recent achievement wouldn&#39;t be possible without you. 🙏🏼 Virtual hugs 🤗<br /><br />Also, do you have a link to a playlist from this practice cause the music is lush 😻",Agatha Jackson,2021-02-01T23:28:08Z,0
I love everything about what you&#39;ve taught and shared.  Total fan and admirer.  Have been working with you daily!  I only wish this last practice had a whisper version of your voice... I can&#39;t look at the screen and relax into the moves I know so well because I can&#39;t see what&#39;s next.  thank you for all you do,Tricia Krzywicki,2021-02-01T23:26:21Z,2
Finishing just 1 day late. This has to be my favorite 30 day series yet. I&#39;m always amazed to be able to do yoga without guidance on day 30. It&#39;s so special,María Mercedes,2021-02-01T23:25:27Z,0
Thank you so much.  I absolutely love your yoga and especially the 30 day journey&#39;s although I dont enjoy the day 30 as much because I feel I am constantly watching you and not relaxing as much as when I can hear you.,Tracey Wassenberg,2021-02-01T23:18:21Z,2

"I was reticent to do this practice yesterday because of the length, and because I didn&#39;t know how well I&#39;d do without guidance, I didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d know what to do, or if I&#39;d have the motivation to seek out all the poses we&#39;ve practiced in these thirty days, I was afraid I&#39;d just go from resting pose to resting pose and not challenge myself. But, I decided this morning to do the practice despite my hesitations, I did all the other 29 days, I should &quot;trust&quot; myself more to do well, and &quot;believe&quot; that I can stay committed the whole length of the practice - after all, the first practice was nearly so long, so I put my mind to this practice, and let me just say - I&#39;m so glad I did, this was one of the most wonderful practices I&#39;ve ever done. I don&#39;t know what I was so afraid of, I had all the skills and tools I needed, and when I fell, literally or figuratively, I returned to my breath and returned to my pose. I felt that Adriene and everyone else practicing was there with me the whole way and it was truly beautiful. I feel like I have such a deeper love for myself and my breath after this journey, and this practice in particular. Thank you thank you thank you to Adriene for all that I&#39;ve learned about the universe and about myself and this wonderful community for going on this journey with me. Namaste.",Aventa Tumal,2021-02-01T22:53:00Z,11

I’ve always disliked the silent day 30, but this year, I found it. I peeked from time to time, but you have trained me well. Today, I may have done the sequences in a slightly different order than you, but I was so close to your choreography! My body knows what to do. Today, I felt like a true yogi.

"Thank you for this BREATH journey. I have really enjoyed it and learned a lot. I feel so good thanks to you. I just want to say that I did not like this last practice. It was too stressful as we did not have your voice to guide us. Yes, I agree that we have learned the language and it makes it much easier, but I did not know what was coming after the poses. Here is an example, if we were doing underdog, I did not know what was next or how long we were supposed to stay because I could not see my computer from that position. Same when I was in a twist position or on a standing position. Your voice and guidance is helpful because in some positions, it is not possible to see the screen and follow the amount of time we are supposed to stay or what comes next. Sorry, I did not enjoy it. See you at the next one.",Alejandra Goyenechea,2021-02-01T21:30:22Z,1
"This little cradle of peace is such a treasure.<br /><br />I have endless gratitude for you, Adriene and your work. I&#39;m right in the middle of a breakup, the peak time where sometimes you feel like you can&#39;t breathe, and the whole first half I was openly and wildly weeping through the practice. I keep waking up in the middle of the night with those great big aching pains reminding me that my person is no longer my person. But every breath allowed me to move with grace through every tear, and by the time warrior came around, I felt strong and whole. <br /><br />I keep telling myself that I&#39;m going to get through this, and now I believe it. I am strong. In the same way I don&#39;t have to look down anymore because I know the earth is there for me, I&#39;m a little less afraid of moving forward on my own, because I know that this and my breath will always be there for me. <br /><br /><br />Thank you for giving me hope.",Alison Chang,2021-02-01T21:28:44Z,0
"Feedback: First off, you&#39;re great. Benji too. I appreciate you. My only complaint is that there are no cues on these final days. I constantly have to look at the tv to see what pose we are heading to. It really takes away from the practice IMO. Even if you did a tone for a cue the switch that would be super helpful. Be well!<br /><br />J",Vreeland Homestead,2021-02-01T21:20:58Z,2

My biggest response to today&#39;s practice was WOW! Last year it made me uncomfortable and frustrated, but this year&#39;s voiceless practice was fun 💖 I listened to my body and made it up as I went along. Whenever I got stuck I would look up for a visual cue. This was an amazing way to close out this month and I&#39;m excited to continue my daily practice :)",DaniCrayons,2021-02-01T21:18:22Z,0

"I loved looking up from time to time and seeing that we were momentarily in tandem, in sync -- so sweet. I was intimidated by the length but knew it was what I needed -- to trust and know that I have the tools to shape my practice -- even if at times I looked up for direction and ideas. Which is not the same as searching outside myself for answers. Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door with no one but me to listen was a special treat, outside my usual zone, and made me inexplicably teary. Thank you for such a valuable journey Adriene and Benji! I&#39;ll be back x x",Una P,2021-02-01T21:13:33Z,0
"my dearest Adriene, you have done it again.  I completed the 30 days only missing day 8 which I later incorporated with another day.  This final practice found me with greater strength and I did not slack off.  I managed 2  &quot;real&quot; chatarungas  - not the belly flops or quick release to the ground ones -  lol, but also a few seconds in crow....  Moreover, during Shavasana, the tears came with a powerful emotional release which I welcomed with open heart. While I have done all these before and held crow longer in the past year, somewhere in this bizarre and crazy covid journey I lost a bit of strength while adding fluff instead ;-(.   No longer my friend, because of you and your determination to change the world, my world is a much happier &amp; peaceful place.  Namastadriene! XO",Maryann Miller,2021-02-01T21:11:55Z,0

"Thank you for this wonderful series. It was my first one, and I got so much from it, including knowing I can come back to my breath, strength, and establishing a good routine around yoga.

I understand it is tradition and will keep that in mind next time, but I found this an odd way to end, and rather stressful!",Robin Hamaker,2021-02-01T21:10:24Z,2

But then I started and did 20-30 minutes by myself, followed my intuition. Then I picked at you and our gaze met :) My breath was with me the whole time. I feel my core like never before and my back is  strong. I have no pain, I feel supported and loved. I really enjoyed those 30 Days of BREATH.: your voice, your sweet words and your humour.

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for years, but this is my first time doing yoga every single day for a whole month and I&#39;m having trouble believing how my body and my relationship to it has changed in these short weeks. I&#39;m completely shocked at how much more flexible and strong I am and how I can feel and see the physical proof of that during and after the daily practices. I&#39;m also no longer getting frustrated with what my body can&#39;t do. This is my body and it is capable of great things and I don&#39;t get angry when I can&#39;t reach, hold, or balance because I revel in what my body CAN do. Adriene, I cannot begin to express how much I love the way you teach and guide yoga. You take your job seriously, while also bringing a great playfulness and lightness to the practice that I&#39;ve needed greatly. Today felt so incredible practicing alongside Adriene and I felt for the first time that I could completely trust my body and trust my breath. I could go on, but anyway, thank you to everyone involved in this journey. I&#39;ve already printed out the February calendar to continue practicing daily with my best friend, who joined me halfway through this journey and previously said she thinks she&#39;d hate yoga and yet she now loves it.

I got a bit teary-eyed in the beginning and at the end because of this beautiful journey we&#39;ve been on. Day 30s are a bit hard for me because I overthink which pose I should be doing next or if I&#39;m doing them evenly on both sides. But today I just came back to my breath and did what I felt I needed. Namaste.",Erika Skorstad,2021-02-01T20:28:28Z,0

"I have been going through a very rough time this month and this practice was the one thing that calmed me down every day,  if I am honest I would like this &#39;30 day journey&#39; to go on forever but I realise that this was the start to set off on my own and discover my own integrity and keep on growing through my journey. Though I am a bit scared and overwhelmend because I don&#39;t have a clear idea on how to get to the next step yet, I believe that my breath will guide the way forward.",Yusu,2021-02-01T20:22:26Z,0

"I was scared to start this practice - which is funny, because I&#39;ve so often wished for a practice more tailored to me. One where the flows went at the pace of my breath, the holds were longer, the shapes right for my body. And here was this invitation to do exactly that, and I was scared. But when I sat down with my breath, it hit me that the message was that <b>I can be trusted to provide that for myself.</b> I spent a good few minutes just sitting and bawling on my mat, honored to be trusted that way.",Youtube Watcher,2021-02-01T20:19:32Z,0

"I was feeling so tired when I stepped (rolled) on the mat but this practice felt so good! I’ve done the January challenges maybe three or four times now and always felt uncomfortable on the last day when I had to “improvise” (I know I’m a day late but I chose to properly finish this series instead of starting with the recommended Feb 1 vid). Today it didn’t feel like improvising at all! My body knew what it wanted to do and all I had to do was follow my own lead! Thank you, Adriene, for strengthening my practice and my self trust!

"Like so many others, I teared up too! It&#39;s been a remarkable and tender journey. Thank you dear Adriene! For most of the practice my dog, Ira, was by my side. He&#39;s 14, very arthritic and with dementia, so most days have unexpected turns. Having you to guide me each day has allowed for a small (but emotionally large) regular routine. It&#39;s also very sweet to see Benji with you. Thank you again, and I&#39;m looking forward to continuing my yoga journey with you.",Kathy Lewallen,2021-02-01T20:01:35Z,0

I felt disconnected during much of this practice.  Constantly looking at what I should do next.  I think I missed the point of breathing and flowing into what feels right rather than worrying about what you were going to do next? I had moments where it just &quot;came&quot; to me.  I will have to revisit it. This entire month was such a journey.  I feel stronger than I have in a very long time.  Thank you Adriene! xoxo,A Lochetto,2021-02-01T19:57:46Z,2
"Adriene - THANK YOU! that was an amazing practice to conclude the past 30 days. never in my wildest dreams would I have ever thought I would commit to something for 30 days, be able to do my own yoga practice and do it for 50 minutes!

"@Alejandra Elizondo you&#39;ve misunderstood me. You say you kept doing what you wanted to do, but I just can&#39;t think up what I want to do. Trying to think up something to do next is stressful and means I can&#39;t enjoy the pose. And you&#39;re meant to balance out each side of the body by spending equal time on them - that&#39;s why people go to classes or watch videos, so they don&#39;t need to time themselves or worry about not matching things up or not knowing what might come next. You say to look at Adriene for inspiration and people here are saying that doing that is a massive drag, that it hurts their neck and disrupts their practice. If I could make up my own practice then I wouldn&#39;t be on YouTube listening to yoga videos.",Prosateuse,2021-02-11T09:05:26Z,2

"Thanks for this beautiful challenge! It helped me so much through the month, to show up for myself. I am going to therapy as I am trying to navigate trough life with past trauma, and doing yoga helped me to breath and be present when I do something challenging. This year has been tough with covid and the challenges I took but it&#39;s so worth it. I&#39;d like to share my thoughts as I was doing this practice and I was a little bit lost in my head, I noticed something. As I was stretching and looking at my knee I saw an old scar, that was made when I was 5 years old and fell on a rock. The memory of it is so fresh, it&#39;s like it was yesterday, but there were no pain and no rock left. My past traumas feel like many scars, but it&#39;s like I still carry these rocks with the memories too attached from it. Like I can feel the weight and the anxiety. I think I never let go of these rocks. I&#39;m still learning but I think I just got one important lesson guys, I can stop trying to fix myself. All this time I just had to let go, don&#39;t pressure myself to do well but instead just be myself, with kindness and good intention. I think I was trying to protect myself from what could go wrong but it no longer serves me. Maybe in a near future I can let go of these heavy rocks, and even if the scars are still there, and I still remember how it got there, I no longer feel it, and I will move past that.",Fanny Auc,2021-02-01T19:39:55Z,0
"A 58 and 59 year old started this challenge! Wow, how strong we grew. Looking forward to February. Not a fan of the non guided, darling voice that led us so incredulously through the month.

I don&#39;t have the ability of putting this into better words: thank you so much, Adriene (and Benji), what you do is truly a gift to so many people, I put so much faith into these 30 days, I felt so lost before, and they weren&#39;t at all what I expected, and from the bottom of my heart I feel so grateful for them, for what&#39;s coming.

"I was fine till I peeked at the video and saw Adrienne wiping some tears away!  I will say, after my first 30 day journey a few months ago, I was so frustrated at the silent long practice and made a comment saying as such. I come forward now, humbly apologizing. Now that I know what to do with a bit more confidence, this practice was amazing. I still peeked every once and a while to get an idea of what sequence to do next. But most of the time, my body knew what to do, my breath anchored me and kept me from hurrying along to try and keep up with Adrienne. And by the end I was emotional in a completely different way! It really is a process and a journey and I wish I had understood that earlier. But everything in it&#39;s time. Thanks so much to Adrienne and everyone who came along! Thank you for helping me make these dark and dismal says some of the most enriching and enlightening. I am so strong now, in so many ways, and I&#39;m so excited to keep exploring that strength you&#39;ve helped me develop.

Thank you to you and your team. Without y&#39;alls guidance I don&#39;t think I would have been able to make it 30 days and hold on to my 2021 goal of &quot;consistency&quot;. I look forward to growing in my yoga practice and into myself. Thank you.,Shar-Narne F,2021-02-01T18:18:28Z,0

Haha I misinterpreted the instructions and started doing my own practice for the first 30 minutes. Then it dawned on me that I &#39;should&#39; be following the video...anyway I decided to continue with my own practice despite my initial reaction to stop because I&#39;d &#39;messed up&#39;. Now I have this practice to look forward to doing tomorrow! p.s thanks Adriene for all your work creating these videos - my soul and body feel soooo nourished :),corey twyman,2021-02-01T18:15:42Z,0

"Adriene - You have helped me dramatically change my life for about a little over a year now (my yoga journey started November 2019). There are no words for the limitless respect, love and gratitude I have for you. I was really excited to start Breath camp on time and truly devote myself to this journey, and after today&#39;s practice I am here with tears in my eyes.

"Aaaand I&#39;m crying. Like every year. I&#39;m so grateful for this yearly tradition, this wonderful practice that finds me when I need it most. And for all the wonderful people doing it as well who share that incredible experience. Today, by listening my breath and my self-talk, I knew that I needed a more restorative practice, and I allowed myself to have one. I still managed to sneak in a crow practice that turned out way better that anticipated ! I followed my own path and I was so happy to reunite with Adrienne at the end. I was like meeting an old friend. Thank you so much !",Jeanne Dézard,2021-02-01T18:09:47Z,0
"Thank you so much. This practice has helped me so much to learn to slow down. It was only yesterday, when I did this practice, that I finally learnt to listen to my body and do child&#39;s pose instead of pushing myself to follow the video. I&#39;ve decided to start every practice in a rest position from now on and ask my body what it needs and not what I want to achieve. And maybe, I&#39;ll want to practice handstands on some days, maybe I won&#39;t but that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not been easy being present last month but it sure has been beneficial to staying sane in lockdown &lt;3 I am so grateful",Victoria-Louise Sweet,2021-02-01T18:09:35Z,0

"This one was difficult for me.  I felt a little bit like a bird being pushed out of their comfy, cozy nest.<br />&quot;But I don&#39;t wanna fly!&quot;<br />And. Because my Chromecast wasn&#39;t working all I had was my phone, and it&#39;s difficult to follow silent yoga cues on a small screen... <br />&quot;So how long do I hang in downward facing dog? What is Adriene doing now?&quot;<br />Hit Pause. Rewind. Try again.<br />After several attempted rewinds and trying to do Exactly what Adriene was doing, I decided that letting go of my codependency and &quot;flying&quot; on my own might be what I needed to do. I decided it must be as important to trust myself as much as I trust Adriene&#39;s lead in yoga. <br /><br />The cool thing was.. what I really appreciated... was that I still heard most of the cues in my head. &quot;Relax your shoulders and face. Press into the four corners of your feet. Rise from your core.&quot; Etc etc <br /><br />And I thought. Hmmm. So. This is about learning what I already know, cementing it and learning to trust myself too. Cool. <br /><br />I&#39;m not going to lie. It was clunky in comparison. And I have a tendency, when left on my own, to be less gentle with my body... but I&#39;m on board with beginning &quot;to fly&quot; and trust myself too.",Andrea Hill,2021-02-01T16:46:03Z,1

I&#39;m a day behind, as my husband decided he wanted to start doing daily yoga after seeing me do this, and so one of the days I did one of your beginner videos with him.  So I&#39;ve actually done 31 days!  Day 30 was a challenge and a treat.  As most of our classes have been between 15-30 minutes, the 50 minutes was quite challenging.  My mind and body both got tired. But I definitely &quot;veered off the railroad tracks&quot; and just tried to use the knowledge I have and do what felt good.  Many blessings from afar.

I just stopped after 15 minutes. I&#39;m trying to look at the screen to see what I&#39;m supposed to be doing but it just hurts my neck to keep doing that. After 29 days I&#39;m disappointed at the ending,Richard Allaway,2021-02-01T14:31:12Z,4
I&#39;m with you Richard. If we could invent our own yoga sequences we wouldn&#39;t be here watching a video. A disappointing end to a good series.,Prosateuse,2021-02-01T19:56:44Z,2

"In the beginning, I was scared of 50 minutes of &quot;non-guided&quot; Yoga and how to fill the practice. I did peek at the video for inspiration sometimes but I found it easier and easier to just move with my breath as time went on. In the end, I had to rewind the video a bit because I wasn&#39;t ready to end yet and wanted the music with me for some additional breaths. So thank you for this incredible journey, Adriene. It truly is about trusting the process sometimes. ❤️",alltimelion,2021-02-01T14:25:22Z,0

"I’m not going to lie, I didn’t really get much out of this practice. I enjoyed all of the other days but this one just left me feeling lost. I ended up just turning it off and doing my own thing. I tried it again today (in case i just had an off day) and same thing. Very bummed, but I loved the rest of the series!!",Megan Arnold,2021-02-01T13:38:55Z,58
"I totally sympathise with all these comments - but please don’t get discouraged by the Day 30 mic-less improvisation session, I found it so daunting too with my first few YWA 30-day programs (as if somehow I’d missed out on something important?..) I’m very happy to say that with each subsequent series Day 30 feels easier and more comfortable - more familiar I guess. This is my 6th YWA program, I only finished today and it actually felt great with just the music and looking up at the screen from time to time for guidance. It’s a kind of delayed gratification for all the practice leading up to it, stick with it if you can!",melomantra,2021-02-09T08:22:45Z,0
"I guess there is no right or wrong move in this practice and Adriene offers us the opportunity to tune in to our bodies and find what feels good, which is what it&#39;s all about - rebuilding the connection with oneself. Not saying it&#39;s easy though.",zofaja Z,2021-02-07T21:08:31Z,1

But Having this journey and showing up on my mat daily, the consistency, the community, its kept me going! I&#39;ve been following YWA for about 5 years now, I even bought a tee Shirt this time as I just wanted to give back! Thank you Adriene for being a beacon of hope, for giving your time and passion so selflessly, for helping so many of us around the world who need these practises now more than ever! 7 months ago I broke both bones in my left arm and following surgery to have metal plates in, I didnt think I would be able to chaturanga ever again! but here I am 7 months later finally healed and following the practise and even managed to try crow pose again!

"First, I wanted to congratulate everyone that got here! ✨ <br>This is not my first time doing one of the 30 days of yoga series but it is the first time I did it consecutively which makes me really proud. On the 3-4 series I&#39;ve done so far, I always felt really lost on day 30, sometimes I would start and then give it up because I didn&#39;t really know what to do or I would feel discouraged, others I&#39;d just skip it.<br>This time, I wanted to stick with it, so I did. And boy, was I marvelled that I did almost the 50 min without doubting, trusting myself and with a smile on my face!! (And barely looked at the video!) I hope this gives hopes to anyone feeling uneasy about the day 30 practice &quot;alone&quot;, you can do it!<br><br>And thank you, Adriene, for the tools you gave us through this journey! 😊<br>Now to keep it up for the rest of the year...",Patricia P.P.,2021-02-01T13:07:13Z,0
"When I first started this practice, I was worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to think of enough flows/poses to fill the whole 50 mins...but as we neared the end, I was inspired to explore so many things I could have kept going even longer.

And what is the difference between the two? hopefully someone knows and wants to share the knowledge? Grateful for your time :)",Margarita Kouvatsou,2021-02-01T09:42:47Z,0

"Thank you so much. What an amazing experience. So mindful, so rewarding. It felt so good to let go a little today and trust myself (trust the mat!). I&#39;ve never been able to do crow pose even for a moment and I cannot believe it but today I did and I held it for a whole inhale and exhale.

"What a beautiful way to finish. I was surprised at myself on how I was able to do my own practice without guidance for 50min! I didn’t think my body would remember a lot of the moves, but it did. I just went with the flow and tried to let my body guide me, instead of me guiding my body. The 50min (which at first felt intimidating) went by so fast and I reached a wonderful state of inner peace and accomplishment. <br>Thank you so much Adrienne for taking the time to teach us, it’s been wonderful. I feel so much more connected to my body and mind. Well done everyone! It’s been an honour to share this journey with so many others around the world. Xx",Alejandra V,2021-02-01T09:16:01Z,0

First time doing and completing 30 Day Yoga Journey and I&#39;m sobbing! Is this normal????,Liz Martinez,2021-02-01T09:04:53Z,0
"Some advice please. I did every day of Breath up to day 21, but then I got ill with food poison and missed the last 9 lessons. It is February 1st. Should I start the Breath from day one and complete all 30 days this month or forge ahead and complete the final days. Something tells me that it is special to complete the 30 in a block form and maybe after being ill I need a restart. Any thoughts on this? It was great and special to start the year this way and very positive and healing, but things happen.",Robert Carrithers,2021-02-01T09:03:43Z,0

"Last year I started yoga with your 30 days HOME during the first lockdown here, it made it a joyful experience in some way with the spring sun on my balcony, but doing these 30 days of BREATH in front of the heater in the living room also made this 2nd (or 3rd?) lockdown a much more comfortable experience. Thank you so much for providing this comfort and joy for all of us! My intention is to do yoga every day of 2021, and so far I&#39;m on the right track!",Jona Marie,2021-02-01T08:22:20Z,0
"This session had a good intention but was not very user oriented. To follow I have to stare the whole time at the screen which is a mass on most of the positions. Why not use short comments? For sure we know the positions now after thirty days, but we do not know your flow in advance, so telling the next position or that to state a change is better.",besch 42,2021-02-01T08:18:15Z,2

"I&#39;ve been trying to complete the 30 days of yoga with you since the beginning of the series. I never did; there was always something - I was too hungry, too full, too tired, to energized, had too much time, not enough time. Searching for the &#39;perfect&#39; moment to do yoga took me more energy than, now I realize, actually doing yoga. This year, I changed my perspective. I did yoga full, hungry, extremely tired, one day I even did it a bit tipsy. I asked myself - What is the worst thing that can happen, if I do yoga in X condition? I knew halfway through our journey, that I will finally do it this year, because my mindset was completely different. But I guess this is something that all the other 30 days and my yoga journey up till now taught me, I just needed more time than I expected :) Thank you!",LaraSch,2021-02-01T07:29:44Z,0

But we thoroughly enjoyed taking this journey with you!!,Joan M.,2021-02-01T06:33:58Z,1

"This is the first time I ever flowed without step by step instruction. I looked up at one point during a crescent lunge and saw Adriene doing one as well. The synchronicity felt so divine. Thank you, Adriene for an empowering, sweet, understanding 30 days.",Sakeau K,2021-02-01T06:28:08Z,12
"Words cannot express my gratitude for these practices. They feel like medicine for my sanity and this time last year they saved me. They were required. One year later I find myself in such a better situation that they now feel like vitamins. Bits of goodness my body gobbles up and cherishes. I’m no longer in danger of sinking. Thank you, Adriene ❤️🙏",Stephanie Pike McDonald,2021-02-01T06:23:43Z,0
"When I first started this, I didn&#39;t think much of it. Oh let&#39;s try my first 30 day yoga plan for fun. What I didn&#39;t know was how amazing the whole journey actually is. I want to tell everyone who showed up, even if it was just for five minutes, you should be proud and I hope this has brought you closer to yourself and your breath. You showed up and that&#39;s what matters. I also want to say thank you to Adriene for providing and opening me up to a new experience. I didn&#39;t think I would fall in love with the practice, but I did. Namaste.",Kore,2021-02-01T06:23:38Z,0

"So many of us got emotional today; me too.  For me it was at the beginning--just feeling how intense life has been, how isolating, how scary lately.  This daily practice with you has been incredibly affirming of what we do have control over, how we can be there for ourselves and with your sweet guidance. I appreciate those moments when you remind us that we have much to give to ourselves, and that it&#39;s right here, if we only take a moment to breath and connect.  This was a very very very good way to start 2021. And Benji is a very lucky guy. thank you.",Emily Marsh,2021-02-01T06:11:45Z,0

"We did it!🎉😃 What a beautiful nurturing journey it has been. The intro had me tearing up, each day of showing up boiled down to this moment of trusting myself, trusting my body, and most of all remembering that my breath has my back, just like you. Thank you Adriene for showing us so much love and light during uncertain times. May this momentum flow into the rest of this year, so that we may continue showing up for ourselves. Love you more than you could know. Namaste😊🙏🏽",Venusha Govender,2021-02-01T06:11:03Z,0
I did it! This is the first time I’ve managed a 30 day challenge every single day without missing a day and coming in a day or two late!

"This is the only journey I have ever kept up with. Anytime I have tried to do something in the past that is similar to this, I have always missed days or just given up before I got to the halfway point. I’m actually really proud that I can say that I have finished the journey without missing a day, and tried the best I possibly could. I have learned so many new things about myself and I am so happy I got to be a part of this.

This was my first 30 day yoga journey and I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. But I can tell you that it went by too quickly and although I usually practiced at night alone in my living room I cannot recall ever feeling more connected. Not just to Adriene but to everyone practicing. That power of connection is so important and maybe I didn&#39;t know how much I needed it until we got closer to the end. But like we have learned every breath is a new beginning. Thank you Adriene and everyone who had a part in this for this incredible journey 💜,Anna Odorisio,2021-02-01T06:02:52Z,0

Thank you Adrienne for giving me and many others the opportunity to take care of our bodies for 30 days. I did this challenge with my sister and it made it even more of an enjoyable moment to know that we did it together. It was a pleasure coming to the yoga mat with thousands of people! After seeing that I could complete these 30 days I can&#39;t wait to begin another journey together and acknowledge my well-being. Thanks again Adrienne (and Benji!)

"Thank you Adriene, for this beautiful journey that you have guided us on. This last practice was amazing, it showed me how much I have grown over the last 30 days. It was challenging, yet I found my ease, my flow. I didn&#39;t expect the flood of emotions at the end as I teared up. <br />As you share your beautiful light and love with us, you are also helping us find the light and love within ourselves.

"I don&#39;t usually have trouble with Day 30, but it was difficult this year. This past year has been so lonely, and I think the connection of hearing a voice guide me along - even though I know I&#39;m capable of guiding my own practice - has become such a comfort for me throughout the months of lockdown and working from home and missing just being around people. Practicing without that today left me feeling uneasy and disconnected. That said, the other 29 days of this have been so exactly what I needed right now and really resonated with me and I&#39;m so so so grateful to Adriene for sharing these beautiful practices.",Jojo Orenji,2021-02-01T05:46:01Z,121
@yogawithadriene maybe a suggestion could be an invitation to mute one&#39;s own sound but to still provide an optional voiceover for those to whom it may benefit? I really felt the same. &lt;3 But loved the other 29 days!! they were perfect! :),Denise Lynch,2021-02-04T23:51:41Z,2
"This was similarly unsettling and difficult for me. When I realized I was going to have to stop and check the screen, the fear of doing it &quot;alone&quot; really hit me. I immediately recognized how hard it was going to be to find the same centering without her the company of her voice and comfort of her guidance. Reading the comments helped me to feel connected again. I am so grateful for this practice especially during such a lonely year.",Ali Dailyn,2021-02-04T21:22:14Z,2

"Definitely a bittersweet practice today. I&#39;m sad that it&#39;s come to a close but I&#39;m so proud of how far we&#39;ve come. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for a couple years now (pretty inconsistently) but this year was the first time that I was able to practice everyday and complete all 30 days. I was admittedly scared of day 30 because I knew there would be no cues or guide but I trusted myself and felt like I didn&#39;t even have to think about my next move.<br /><br />This practice has opened my heart and has truly helped me stay grounded off the mat when things might seem out of control. Yoga has become an important part of my daily routine and I&#39;m so glad that I said yes on day 1. I successfully held back my tears during the practice but definitely cried like a baby when I heard the outro in shavasana and all could think was &#39;I did it! I did all 30 days!&#39;<br /><br />With all that said, thank you for taking me on this incredible journey.",Kori R,2021-02-01T04:55:23Z,2

"Yoga is such a special and personal thing, and it&#39;s so beautiful that we can share it with so many people around the world.<br />Thank you so much for these last 30 days, Adriene. In the beginning I frequently stopped to cry because it was so hard for me at the time, mentally and physically. This being after so long at home alone every day with my desk job, not getting any movement because of the pandemic. It hurt and I felt weak and embarrassed. Your emphasis on showing up being the hardest part rang in my head any time I felt like not putting in the time or effort- so I did exactly that, and showed up. Every day. I could spend forever talking about how this has changed me, but I&#39;ll sum it up by saying I feel a lot more human and I&#39;m finally strong enough to call downward dog a resting pose haha.<br />Getting back into yoga was one of my three New Years resolutions- Breath really was the perfect thing, and at the perfect time for me. I will be showing up again every day, starting tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait!",Oh No,2021-02-01T04:53:43Z,5
"A couple notes from today&#39;s practice that I feel like sharing-<br />A few times I looked up and noticed I was doing the same thing at the same time as Adriene 😂<br />For it being 50 minutes, it sure flew by<br />At one point I looked in the mirror and had to stop and smile at myself because I felt so happy to be me<br />I&#39;m also really proud I made it this far",Oh No,2021-02-01T04:57:53Z,0

Thank you for reminding me how precious it is to take time to connect with our breath and ourselves.

"Thank you Adriene for the past 30 days and being my teacher as I made my first authentic attempt at yoga.  I did not feel comfortable without guidance and didn&#39;t make it through the entire video today, but I am still proud of making it through all 30 days and giving today an honest attempt.  Now I have something to aspire to in my practice.  Normally I would beat myself up over &quot;failing&quot; today but that is an old version of me.  My new story is of a man who shows up, makes an attempt, and accepts when growth is still needed.  A man who is present and is connected to his breath.  You came along at a time of my life where I&#39;m transforming into the person I was always meant to be, and thus you will always be a part of that story.  I am grateful to you, Benji, whoever helps you produce this amazing content, and all of the people who participated in this with me.  I will see you again.  With love, Jason",Jason Sandmann,2021-02-01T04:41:33Z,1

"In a way, this was the most beautiful practice this month. I&#39;m so incredibly proud of myself for making it this far. I&#39;ve never completed a 30 day journey...I usually don&#39;t make it a week. <br /><br />I&#39;m proud of everyone else who stuck this far! It&#39;s sad to see the views dropping so dramatically in the beginning after the first few days, and each video gained less and less... so for those of you that made it here... congrats!<br /><br />There were times I kept up with Adriene, and there were times I closed my eyes and did my own thing. <br /><br />There were even times that I glanced up and saw that Adriene was doing something I just did, like knocking on heaven&#39;s door. It felt so natural. <br /><br />There was an emotional realization about halfway though of &quot;I did it... I did it!&quot; And I felt complete and total freedom. This journey was beautiful, and has changed me for the better. I plan to continue my daily yoga practice, and I look forward to looking back in the future and realizing how far I&#39;ve come!",Kayla McKeehan,2021-02-01T04:40:23Z,0
"Thank you, Adriene! This has been a privilege to participate in. I had to peek at you about 30 minutes in when my creativity ran out, but I am so proud of myself for seeing it through.

I do the 30 Day challenges with my visually impaired roommate and I always forget then dread Day 30. We end up having to do a completely different video because he needs the audio cues to know what&#39;s coming. I&#39;ve tried helping him by telling him what&#39;s happening on-screen but it ends up distracting us both.

And I made it all the way through! I got a little emotional. Thank you for reminding me that I am stronger than I think! I can&#39;t wait for February!",amoore32,2021-02-01T04:23:11Z,0
"dear adriene, I have always loved yoga but gave it up as a practice almost twenty years ago because of persistent and sudden bouts of vertigo - i basically plan my activities around not inverting my head and triggering an attack. Found you in december rather randomly when i was looking for some lower back exercises, and then decided to embrace the 30-day yoga practice. It has been amazing every step of the way - you reminded me of why i used to like yoga, but i also don&#39;t think i have ever encountered an instructor who taught with as much clarity and empathy as you do. <br />3 days ago - day 27! - I had a sudden attack of vertigo during a side twist - and I thought I would have to just give up as I have in the past. But your encouragement to always practice modifications and work with what you have gave me courage to complete the last 3 days, and also not to live in fear of bringing on a vertigo attack. It happens, i still can survive. I can&#39;t go on, I go on. <br />I look forward to many many more days of yoga to come, and also practicing <b>with</b> vertigo as that is part of me, too. Thank you for everything.",Eileen Cheng-yin Chow,2021-02-01T04:21:33Z,0

"“Big inhale.” “Up and over.” “Feet together, really together.” “Shift forward to look forward, heels reaching toward the back of your mat.” “Nod your head a little yes, nod your head no.” “Find some gentle movement.” “Inhale to lift up, exhale to lower all the way down.” “Catch a wave.” “Slowly and with control.”  “Come back to center.” “Navel tucks in.” “Don’t forget to breathe.” -Just a few of the things I heard in your voice in my head as we guided me through this practice. I’m so thankful for the time I put into showing up each day. Thank you for sharing your craft with us.

"DAY30. Spectacular feeling to have completed it... our annual 30-Day YOGA Challenge, Adriene. It&#39;s wonderful each year for 7 years now with you, kind of losing count. Always an emotional moment at the end when you bow to us. We bow to you equally. I thought this one was never gonna end, the longest 30 days it seemed. Will you make the next one next year a tad bit more balanced with breathing &amp; exercises combined in each session, please. This felt like sometimes we had only breath and sometimes only packed with asanas, one after the other. I like it more when each session is more equally spread. Also, may we have DAY1 released a day sooner please, beause Australia/Europe are ahead of your time zone. You are an angel. BTW. your SI Joint VIDEO has helped me a lot 1,5 year ago. Infinite thanks &amp; blessings, your friend, STELLA..  ♡♡♡ 😘 xx..",Stella Johnson,2021-02-01T04:14:40Z,1

"We did it!!!! I have tried to commit to a 30 day yoga challenge so many times in the last few years always starting from the point of hating how I looked and sometimes so determined to change that I would attempt 30 days of yoga on top of daily exercise routines and additional cardio. Usually made it about a week. My body was something to be critiqued not something I even felt connected to. This year after a crazy year I decided to try starting with loving myself for who I am right now and seeing what I could accomplish. This was the first times I’ve been sitting here after a Day 30, successful. Showing up everyday, actually focusing on my breath not waiting for more planks. I could never have imagined feeling like this, able to actually spend a quiet minute with myself with no negativity and no thinking ahead.

"After getting very sick in the middle of the Home Series and not being able to continue until March, this felt very rewarding!  I lead my own practice.  There were times where I was in sync with Adriene and times where I wasnt and for the first time I went with the flow and hardly glanced at the camera!  Way to go everyone!

"Well, I honestly didn&#39;t expect to sob at the end. I realized during the practice how much stronger I felt. But it really dawned on me that it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve been able to devote time and movement and stillness to myself. I don&#39;t know what it was...it really felt like a release of so much. Truly, thank you for this opportunity to breathe.",Goddess Cecilia,2021-02-01T03:39:43Z,0
That was truly amazing. There wasn’t a day that went by that I didn’t want to do yoga with this community at the end of my day. I wasn’t always into it in the beginning but I never regretted doing it. I am so grateful for this practice and grateful for Adriene’s loving non-judgmental guidance. I celebrate us all.

We each had our own stories, struggles, and accomplishments to share. Reading the uplifting and heartfelt comments on each video made me truly realize that I am never alone when I practice. For Adriene: You have changed my life, quite literally, forever. I am so incredibly grateful for this past month, and for the past two years I have practiced with you. I cannot wait to see what the future will bring and what changes will come. Namaste! :)",Lexi Jensen,2021-02-01T03:39:00Z,0
I did an 8 km hike today in the snow and really wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d make it to this last day... so happy I convinced myself to atleast try.

"I enjoyed the first 29 days, but I couldn’t do this one because of the lack of cueing.  Too much neck strain.  A bummer after being diligent all month.",mrachel3,2021-02-01T03:35:26Z,18
@Nova Albrecht I feel like some people may have missed her saying this in the beginning. It wasn’t outright said but she left it for us to interpret how we do the day. I found myself following her as much as I could but even when my neck was turned or couldn’t see I instinctively knew what to do next or have learned how long to hold from the month of practice. <br /><br />I get the criticism but I think they lack a bit of context in knowing this was meant to be your own session rather than a session you follow.,Albert Garcia,2021-02-03T18:37:42Z,0
"I agree. This is my 3rd 30 day challenge, and  I just don&#39;t do the last day as too difficult to know what&#39;s next straining to see the screen, and more importantly...  feels lonely not having any cues or encouraging words.",Judy McGregor,2021-02-03T17:22:33Z,2
@Debbie F exactly.  A second upload with voice over cueing would really help and give people the choice of cueing or no.,mrachel3,2021-02-03T15:37:15Z,2
"I totally understand that! Normally I substitute for the mic-less practices or just skip, because the first time I did one it was pretty unpleasant. I think her intention with these is for us to come up with our own practice based on what our body is asking for, and we can just look to her if we run out of ideas— I took that approach today and I actually had a great time!",Nova Albrecht,2021-02-03T01:16:12Z,7
"Totally agree. I wrote almost the same thing. I did it, but was frustrated and it didn&#39;t have near the flow. Disappointing as I was looking forward to a 50 minute session.",Debbie F,2021-02-02T19:05:52Z,2
Thanks so much for these amazing practices! You have truly helped me managed this past year! Love these Praxiteles !! Would it be at all possible to have Adrienne record the day 30 session with the microphone so we can use this complete practice after!I have really learned to follow her voice when doing her yoga practices and fins it mush easier to follow when she leads verbally as opposed to trying to follow ever move by looking at the screen to follow the practice. -would love to use several of the “day 30” practices post her 30 day challenges ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏😊,Karen Brett,2021-02-01T03:35:07Z,0

"This is my fourth (or fifth) 30 days of YWA, and this was the first time I actually did the final practice in full. Before today, I’ve always felt lost and a little sad that Adriene wasn’t guiding me in our last day. But I flowed with you, in sync some of the time. Doing my own thing (off the rails a little) at others. Thank you for gifting me the tools and vocabulary to feel calm and confident in my practice. It definitely isn’t as graceful as yours, but I hold it precious because you taught me to. As you say, ‘I love you so much. Take good care.’",Morgan Aceino,2021-02-01T03:28:04Z,1
"Adriene Adriene! i was dreading today&#39;s practice a little because i never know what to do in day 30. however this was the first 30-day challenge that i managed to complete without missing a single day, so i dragged myself to the mat... after reading all of the encouraging words of my fellow YWA community. i followed my breath.. and the muscle memory we&#39;ve developed... and i delivered 39 minutes of movement before i found my self flat on my back in shavasana HAAHAA. i ran out of ideas and got slightly bored lol. however this has been the best (and personally the most challenging) 30-day challenge and i cherishhhhh youuu and benji. thank you very much, you&#39;ve done this world a lot of good &lt;3",Clarissa Amabel,2021-02-01T03:27:20Z,1

"This is the first 30 day journey I&#39;ve done and was so proud of myself for making it onto my mat 29 days in a row. I&#39;ve never stuck with any intention or habit that long. And I had no idea what to expect today. When Adriene basically told me to trust myself and find what feels good and then took off her mic, I honestly burst into tears. I sat on my mat and cried for a minute, feeling the absolute enormity of not having her voice in my ear guiding me and making me smile and reassuring me. It felt deeply vulnerable, asking me to trust myself for an hour and guide my own practice. So I cried. And then I sat and grounded in my breath. And then somehow I DID know what I needed. I moved through my practice with so much love for myself and for this space. I felt strong and graceful and more connected to my body and my movement and my breath than I have in a long time. This was simultaneously the greatest challenge and the sweetest gift. Thank you.",Sam Bergen,2021-02-01T03:21:16Z,0

"Congrats everyone! This is the first 30 day journey that I completed, though I&#39;ve started a few in the past. Last year I really started doing yoga, but I didn&#39;t really do it regularly till late November. Throughout then till end of December I only did yoga 5 days a week, constantly skipping days because I didn&#39;t feel like it. This month is the first I&#39;ve done every single day without missing a day :) Nothing wrong with missing a day, but any time I thought about skipping I kind of just said, screw it, and came to the mat. Though I didn&#39;t last the full 50 minutes today, I did do my own 30 minute routine and it felt amazing. I&#39;m planning on starting Home tomorrow, just because I want another 30 day journey to go on. Thank you Adriene, Breath has been a treat",Daelyn Biendarra,2021-02-01T03:12:11Z,0

Thank you so much for this journey!!! It honestly has been life changing for me!!! I&#39;m so proud to say that even on the bad days I pushed through and made it to my mat. This has been such a great awakening moment to where I have grown and I have been able to let my emotions out in such a beautiful way. Much love and many blessings to you!

"I thought i had control of my breath, but these 30 days told me “psh, just wait.” I feel like my yoga has gotten sooo much better by giving the breath the steering wheel. What a journey, I miss it already! Namaste Adriene &amp; all those who did this journey together!!!",Becky Celestina,2021-02-01T02:46:49Z,13

"Wow, that was beautiful and so unexpected. I never thought in a million years I would 1. Practice yoga every single day for 30 days and 2. I never ever thought I would be able to create my own flow. In the middle of my flow it all sunk in and brought me to tears, this translates to so many other aspects of life too. Thank you Adriene for being such an amazing instructor and giving us the tools to be our best. My goal at the beginning of the year was yoga for a year and now my wish is a reality with my favorite teacher. 🥰",Marisha Bailey,2021-02-01T02:45:46Z,6

"This was my first 30 Day journey and have never felt more grounded or in tune with myself. To be honest I was somewhat hesitant going freestyle in this last video, but I connected with my breath, listened to my body, and opened my third eye - it was an incredible feeling. Also decided today was the day and was FINALLY able to get both my feet off the ground for Crow Pose!!! Only for a few seconds but still, so so excited to continue to find what feels good! Thank you for everything, Adriene &amp; Benji :)",spencer morse,2021-02-01T02:45:27Z,3
This day made me cry Adrienne. I’ve never completed a challenge ever in my life because I never truly believed in myself. I feel like I just won a trophy and I want to celebrate haha. I’ve grown a new love and appreciation for yoga and what it does for me because of this. This is more than what it looks like this is about committing to myself and loving myself where I’m at unconditionally. The marathon of self love will continue. Thank you,tish nincy,2021-02-01T02:45:15Z,3

"Thank you Adriene. I started practicing with you the beginning of April. This was the first 30 days that I did live. Each morning I would get up, look over the practice and read the comments. You inspire goodness in others through your example, sacrifice and commitment. From a classroom teacher of over 30 years,  I know this undertaking was not easy. It truly was a labor of love. For that, thank you. I will see you on the mat, and I&#39;m excited to participate in my first live class:) You ROCK &lt;3",Kristen Tinucci,2021-02-01T02:42:33Z,0
"Woah... this has been such a wonderful experience. I&#39;ve gotten frustrated and anxious, but I have also been calm and curious. This entire month has helped me to strengthen my relationship with my breath again. Having as many panic/anxiety attacks that I do, the best thing I can keep doing is breathing. My mind needs to return to my breath. I feel more connected to it now than ever. That was the most zen practice I have had in a while. I teared up a little when the theme music played at the end. It&#39;s been a wild ride everyone, and I am so glad that I was able to practice with all of you. Knowing we are not alone in our practices makes them just a little bit more interesting. I love you all, and thank you for showing up, whether you did the whole month, or just three days. From the state of NC, Namaste ❤",Maria S,2021-02-01T02:41:32Z,0

Okay...I totally missed something here. And the comments confirms. I tired to do her practice because apparently I have a yoga co-dependancy. I think there&#39;ll be a redo.,Rachel B,2021-02-01T02:40:03Z,1
"@Prosateuse yes, and having things called out to me lets me drop more into the moment and relax. Freestyle is awesome but can be very challenging to do it for 50 minutes when you&#39;re not a yoga teacher...but then again no one said you had to flow or you had to do all 50 minutes.  But I would have loved to do her practice which was very nice and different from usual yoga classes.",Rachel B,2021-02-01T11:27:03Z,0
"I really can&#39;t do it without someone calling out the poses, it&#39;s so distracting mentally to have to make up your own sequence on the fly. I don&#39;t really get what other people seem to have experienced. Looking at the screen all the time is so awkward.",Prosateuse,2021-02-01T05:05:44Z,1
"I had a hard time losing myself in this final practice without the audio cues - too much peeking at the screen needed. Guess I am not ready to go it alone with a 50 min practice yet!

"I&#39;m a few days behind due to illness and just finished this today, but can relate to feeling &quot;lost&quot;.

Good Morning All. I echo your comments about the audio cues. However I believe Adrienne has placed her trust in us to “Do What Feels Good “. We all know enough after 30 days to be acquainted with the different asanas. Adrienne is not judging us on how much we know and do. For me 30 - 40 mins was adequate and then I sat and watched her gracefully complete her practice. Namaste 🙏 x,78fisguard,2021-02-03T09:45:08Z,5

"Thanks for your content, Adriene. Much needed, especially right now. I found that without verbal cues, I had to look up at my TV constantly during this one, which was uncomfortable and took me out of the moment. Wonder if you would consider dubbing cues over future full practices. Just a thought!",Bryn Olson,2021-02-01T02:35:49Z,0
"Proud of everyone who made it this far!!<br /><br />This was my very first 30 Day Journey and I was very surprised when I learned that we won&#39;t be guided for this last session. Though I was anxious at first, I just decided to sit on the mat, breathe (get it??) and do what my body wants, then I ended up with a flow that I enjoyed (which I didn&#39;t know was possible just by doing this for thirty days).<br /><br />To those who didn&#39;t like craning their heads to look at the video every so often, maybe try coming up with a flow just by listening to your body? That&#39;s what I did for this session and maybe that might work for you, too.<br /><br />Thank you so much Adriene, the whole YWA Team and all of you who participated in this 30 Day Yoga Journey!

Day 30 is aways a little intimidating for me at first, but I&#39;ve found that once I get started, things start to flow, and it&#39;s really fun to decide what direction to go in! <br /><br />I also flashed right back to this time last year when the Home music played, and I remembered working my way through Dedicate this past spring and True in the summer when I heard those themes. Yoga has helped so much with the isolation over the course of the last year, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who feels that way.

I&#39;ve done 30 day journeys in the past and have always had a little trouble on day 30 when it came to the quiet practice. I typically would spend too much time looking up anticipating the next move. But today I took a BREATH and trusted my body and the practice and it was so invigorating. <br /><br />Thank you to all of you out there in the community - I truly enjoyed this practice with you and reading about all of your experiences and uplifting comments.

"Great job guys! My fam came in earlier than expected, about twenty minutes from the end and started talking over my silent practice including to me. I’d already cried once (my heart burst thinking of all of you knocking on heavens door at your own homes) and honestly the end felt like emotional blue balls not having the privacy to embrace the moment. People were literally asking me things mid practice and Jesus that was hard to deal with since it doesn’t normally happen (I don’t have kids or sweet fur babies so normally it’s a bit of peace). But we got through it with some breath and a private cry in my room. Good work everyone, so proud of you all ❤️🎉❤️💙",Allison Burtenshaw-deVries,2021-02-01T02:20:14Z,0

Pranayama is one of my favorite parts of yoga and I knew I&#39;d love Breath as soon as it was announced.

"Wow Adriene, that was beautiful. I did not think I could do this, at the beginning my mind was racing but you&#39;re right, we have the vocabulary within us and to my disbelief I led myself through a practice of my own making. I kept hearing your voice in my mind, guiding me through. <br />Hearing the outro music and realizing you and Benji had already left the screen before I realized the practice was over made me very emotional. Thank you for everything, Adriene.",Emily D,2021-02-01T01:54:46Z,0
"What a delightfully perfect surprise today was. This is my first 30 day challenge of yours that I&#39;ve completed and I didn&#39;t know about the 30th day tradition: let me just say, though there were of course times that I paused and got a little lost, I can&#39;t believe how freeing this experience was. A couple times I looked at my screen to see we were in the same poses! It was a magical feeling to use my breath as inspiration - it really made the time fly and kept me curious during this very long session. It really gives me hope for the days to come, hoping to incorporate daily yoga from now on. This is a long comment but it has truly been an amazing month with this community, experiencing the beautiful growth, both physical and mental, this practice has brought. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! Love you sweet Adriene and Benji, namaste &lt;3",Megan Elaine,2021-02-01T01:54:23Z,2

Let the breath move you... that was all I could think when I started feeling worried that I wouldn’t move at the right time (or miss the next pose) without her words to guide me. Once I really let go and trusted my breath I was able to follow along without relying too much on watching my screen. Trust the breath. Trust yourself. THAT is what I’ve learned through this journey.   ABSOLUTELY beautiful way to close out the 30 days.  Thank you Adriene. 🙏🏻✨,Abby Huston,2021-02-01T01:32:13Z,0

"When you said it&#39;s a day 30 tradition to turn off your mic, I felt very emotional, not because I didn&#39;t think I could do it, but because I knew I could. That kind of confidence and strength has been built little by little and this 30 day yoga journey solidified it. This was one of the most beautiful and loving practices I have ever experienced and the first one I did completely without guidance. Thank you Adriene for this incredible Breath journey and I am so thankful to be a part of it. Congratulations to everyone who also completed this journey!",Jessica Neboyskey,2021-02-01T01:28:54Z,0
"dear Adriene,<br />I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve made it. I&#39;ve learned more this month than I did for years in my life. I&#39;ve gained knowledge about discipline, focus, love, breath. I&#39;ve realized that&#39;s okay to feel vulnerable. that not everyday is gonna be a good one, but that&#39;s not the end of the world. that breath is always there for me. although there&#39;s still a lot to learn, today i feel more mature about my relationship with my mind and my body. and that&#39;s thanks to yoga, and to you as the amazing instructor and human you are. this feels like a sweet ending, but it&#39;s also the beginning of a new journey, and I&#39;m letting you know that I&#39;m taking you with me! I will be forever grateful.<br />sending you, and benji, and whoever&#39;s reading this, all my love. 💌",ana ferreira,2021-02-01T01:28:18Z,0

"And here I find myself at the end of an incredible journey... showing up for myself every day for 30 days without fail. While the physical changes i&#39;ve experience have been great, it&#39;s the mental aspects that have really changed my perspective. I&#39;ve been practicing with you since 2016 (albeit inconsistently) yet this month I noticed an incredible gain of flexibility and strength of MIND. Even without your guiding voice today, as I flowed alongside you, my own voice came to me. Only kind words, words of affirmation, &quot;I&#39;m doing great, keep going!&quot; &quot;I am strong&quot; &quot;I am love&quot;. Adriene I cannot begin to thank you for the amount of worth and love you&#39;ve instilled in me, or perhaps it was your guidance that awoke it and brought it out of me. For the entirety of today&#39;s practice I had a huge smile on my face, amazed by how incredible and beautiful my body is for being capable of doing this. You always thank us for sharing our time and practice with you, but today I was to say the biggest thank YOU for sharing YOUR time and practice with us. Thank you for always being here for me over the past 5 years. Whenever I need a place to relax or clear my head, I always find my way back here. I extend eternal love and gratitude for you, Adriene, and I can&#39;t wait to keep practicing alongside you for the rest of this year, and hopefully for the rest of my life... Namaste.",Viola Bolik,2021-02-01T01:27:16Z,0
"The Day 30 practices always scare me, and I end up watching Adriene the entire time so I know what to do, but this time I trusted myself, and oh my god.  That was an incredible practice.

"I have a hard time with Day 30s because I like to follow at least somewhat - so I end up cranking my neck and moving my computer around. Otherwise I could just do a solo practice? I know many people who LOVE this Day 30, so I&#39;m just going to breathe, get through it and onward. Thanks Adriene!",Katy Foster,2021-02-01T00:56:41Z,3
Three times we looked at each other and smiled while heading into the same movement. I wasn’t even watching her for most of it yet our paths would cross on the mat. A truly amazing experience to learn that I do have the tools and the knowledge to be successful on my own. I can do this. I am strong. Can’t wait to continue our journey together Adrienne.,Sugarcube599,2021-02-01T00:56:34Z,119

"I know I started this practice late in the day but regardless, every time we managed to sync up, it felt like we were connecting and doing the practice together. Somehow, maybe through breath, we would always come back to the same poses. Despite not being guided, somehow I knew exactly what to do (and got so in the zone I did a crescent lunge in twice on the same side). Somehow this practice was exactly what I needed and I got off the mat and started crying? That’s never happened to me before. Thank you so much for everything Adriene. ❤️ Love to you and Benji, Namaste",Ev O,2021-02-01T00:56:32Z,18

"This was so special. Thank you, Adriene, for guiding us in the most loving way. I&#39;ve done previous yoga journeys with you but this one hit different. Maybe it&#39;s the times, maybe it&#39;s where I&#39;m at in my life, but wow. I needed this on more levels than I knew. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I&#39;ll take these tools with me as I go forward on an off the mat. PS was vibing hard with the musical themes from past 30 day journeys! Xoxo",Maya Davis,2021-02-01T00:55:39Z,1

"Long-time YWA follower here (since 2015), but this is the first year I&#39;ve actually done a 30 Day Journey &quot;in real time&quot; as the videos have been released! (E-mail reminders certainly do help!) And I feel great! \o/<br /><br />Day 30 is often a struggle for me because I miss hearing Adriene guide us through the practice—not just the instruction but also her humor, thoughtfulness, and soul-searching ideas/prompts. But one thing I love about Day 30? Listening to the theme music from all the previous 30 Day Journeys. It&#39;s a nostalgic wave of good feels every time. 🥰<br /><br />Thank you, Adriene. Lots of love to you and everyone, and may we all find joy in the journey—on and off the mat! Namaste! ❤️🙏",Kristina Young,2021-02-01T00:54:59Z,0

"OH NO ITS OVER! Thank you so much for this, it was a joy to share these moments with you and with all my fellow humans across the globe! It was my very first 30-day journey and I was a little worried about flowing &quot;freestyle&quot;, so I followed your lead until about halfway through. I really wanted to try Crow again, so I slowly flowed my way down to a crouch to try it again and I DID IT. I MANAGED TO STAY IN CROW!! s u c c e s s ! ! That alone gave me the boost of confidence I needed to try different things  for the rest of the practice, so I did c:<br /><br />We met once again in Dancer, purely by chance, bc I also wanted to try it again and just as I extended my arm, there you were moving into Dancer. <br /><br />Thank you again for these, your videos are a gift &lt;3",Lucca Pereira Rodrigues,2021-02-01T00:49:11Z,0
"This was so empowering. I have never practiced on my own and when you announced that you wouldn&#39;t wear your mic, I almost quit. I didn&#39;t think I was ready. Instead, I decided to push myself through the discomfort, just to try it. I had trouble starting but once I got it, I just kept going! Hearing nothing but the music and my breath really helped me make a connection I&#39;ve never given myself the chance to make. Very proud of myself and everyone else on this journey!",Ashley Leanna,2021-02-01T00:48:55Z,0

Thank you so much Adriene for this beautiful ride, full of ups, happy and sad tears what a ride it was woooh!

It does not stop here and i am committed to the 365 days of yoga. I also want to applaud to all of you for showing up no matter what.

"I&#39;ve always struggled with this final day tradition. In the past, I have tried to follow along with Adriene&#39;s practice and as a result, felt frustrated and out of sync. This time was different. I didn&#39;t look at the screen, I just listened to the music and did the movements that came to me. When one didn&#39;t come naturally, I paused to breathe. I guess that among everything else I have learned, I took a step towards listening to myself and my body today. Thank you for this journey, Adriene.",Miriam Stobbe Reimer,2021-02-01T00:43:19Z,1

"I have enjoyed the videos and 30 day yoga journey up until today. I would feel comfortable trying to go through a flow on my own, but having a video without voice guidance puts pressure on us to crane our necks to watch the video.

"Adriene, I have to thank you so much for everything you have taught me with your Yoga with Adriene classes. I began doing your videos last March when the quarantine started, after years of resisting committing myself to yoga. I now do at least one of your videos everyday, often two. Today is my 38th birthday, and as I worked through the final day of Breath with you, I found myself getting quite emotional. I am just so proud of how far I have come during the past year. I have strength, flexibility, balance, and the ability to manage my stress in ways that I never knew I was capable of before you gave me these tools. Thank you so much for the incredible gifts you have given me. I love you and look forward to an amazing year with you as I continue my yoga journey.",Brittany Todd,2021-02-01T00:29:01Z,1

"I used to have a recurring voice injury, and I was stunned when the doctor told me I was “breathing wrong.” How could I be messing up something that’s instinctual? Apparently, I held my breath too often, or used up all my air before another inhalation (think: stuck in the Kumbhaka).<br /><br />I eventually became a speech-language pathologist, but not before I’d accumulated years’ worth of compensatory habits (lifted shoulders, strained neck) and psychological trauma from being unable to control my voice and breath (croaking in unexpected moments, fear of singing). All of which I’m still unlearning even after 8 years after my last injury.<br /><br />Yoga with Adriene was the only thing that got me practicing regularly, after dabbling in yoga for years (even hated it back in college!) Last March was when I did my 1st 30-Day, Home, and have been on the mat consistently since. In the span of one year, I’ve been healing my mind and nourishing my body with every inhale, and not forgetting to exhale!<br /><br />On the last day of Home, I froze and cried when Adriene said she’d go off mic; I felt sad that it was ending and panicked that I wasn’t ready to flow on my own. But I found my own pace, and my body found its own voice.<br /><br />At the start of today’s session, I found myself crying again, but this time from so much joy, and acknowledging how far I’ve come, and thinking about so many people around the world with their own sets of struggles, but all journeying with me. How much more fitting when some of the music from past 30-day challenges accompanied my movement, like a soundtrack to my growth? No sadness now that “it’s ending,” because so long as I have breath, I’ve stopped deciding where it ends.<br /><br />THANK YOU, ADRIENE! NAMASTE, EVERYBODY! 🇵🇭",Teacher Kaye,2021-02-01T00:25:57Z,6

Ahhhh the longest practice flew by as if it was the shortest one! Thank you from the bottom of my ❤️ Adriene for these 30 Days of Breath and in these times when so many are apart from their loved ones it means all the more to know we are all practicing together from all across the world united by our journey with Adriene.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I think this turned out to be my favorite day of this series.  Breath was difficult for me to land in despite (or, perhaps, because of) the fact that I spent 2020 grounding in yoga and using it as a tool to center myself.  I found myself mildly dreading this day, even though it has always been my favorite, especially once I found out how long it was.  But I arrived, I took a breath, and I allowed myself to land, finally, wholly.  I finally looked at some real fears I have been aware of but ignoring the last month.  I finally surrendered to my intuition.  This day healed me as it always does - always when I need it.  I am so excited to move into February after this beautiful journey.  I know I gained and grew so much in these last 30 days and will be discovering just how much for a while, I&#39;m sure.  I think I&#39;m going to spend the next seven days in a chakra series and then the rest of the month listening to what I need each day and finding a video (or meditation music) to fit it.<br /><br />Yoga has truly taken all the scattered parts of me and made me whole, connected.  Adriene, I have been returning to your videos for several years now, but recently made a commitment to yoga every day June 1, 2020.  Thank you for your support and this community.  YWA is truly a gift.",Rachel Bonarek,2021-02-01T00:15:46Z,0

"This has been my 3rd 30 day challenge in a row for me. Each year had a different flavor and layers of me that I was able to release. It feels so timely and almost obvious that this year had to be the time for BREATH. Thank you Adriene and Team YWA. We love you. Will continue to do YWA every single day, just as I was doing in 2020. It has been an honor dear friends. Namaste!",Darla Addams,2021-02-01T00:15:37Z,1

"thank you Adriene for another wonderful journey... I did Home last year, and  recalled this morning that we would be led by your movements and not by your voice. I got very emotional last year, and of course this year I did too (and somehow even more). the music connects perfectly with the movement, and provides great cues... when I heard the theme from Home, got a bit teary-eyed! you are such a gifted instructor, and I appreciate everything you share with us. I&#39;m so happy I found you and your community. :)",Jenny Kallista,2021-02-01T00:10:09Z,0
"I bow to you Adriene, and to everyone who did this journey. Peace and love be with you all days of your life. It was a blessing to be on this journey, to be given the opportunity to discover something new within me each day, and to be extended an invite to build a bridge between my body and my mind. I hope it is the first bridge of many to come - bridge between the people of my life, a bridge between new faces, a bridge between love and kindness. I thank you, Adriene, because your offering is like a salve, and you do this for free, so that everyone can have the opportunity to receive it. I am in awe.",Gee J,2021-02-01T00:07:33Z,18

I really wanted to love this last day practice as the 29 days were absolutely fantastic!  I will try Day 30 again but I think I need to watch it through first or just minimize the screen so I can&#39;t see Adriene at all.  I know I have the tools to practice on my own but I kept looking at the screen- I was more than a step behind every pose. I couldn&#39;t get myself to relax into this practice even with trying to focus on my breath and trying to go free style. I obviously have more work to do as I&#39;m not ready for a solo flight. Thank you though for the wonderful journey.,heidi lynn,2021-02-01T00:07:02Z,1
"I didn&#39;t fully realize what a gift the past 30 days has been until today. I spent the first ten minutes with beautiful tears of gratitude streaming down my face. Thank you for helping me begin to uncover my truth and strength. This will always be an especially powerful memory for me as my growing baby did each and every session with me, cradled in my belly and moving with my breath.

This year was so special. I&#39;ve spent most of the 30 days going through and recovering from COVID. Some days it took all I had to show up but I did it - even if all I could do was breathe and take child&#39;s pose a lot. The breath work was so meaningful in so many ways. Thanks to everyone else who showed up this month and practiced with me! Thanks to Adriene and the FWFG team. You are all angels. Namaste &lt;3,Emily Paul,2021-02-01T00:05:01Z,1

Well done to everyone for making it this far!  But I&#39;m wondering what is everyone going to do next?<br /><br />Are you going to start another 30 days with Adriene or maybe concentrate on individual postures? Feeling like I was part of everyone doing this together got me through some of the tougher practises but now I&#39;m not sure what to do tomorrow. <br /><br />I know I&#39;ll return to my mat ( with Adriene&#39;s voice whispering &quot;half the battle is showing up&quot;) but I&#39;m just a bit lost as to which direction to take.,TheSCJA,2021-02-01T00:02:18Z,0

It has been a test of my character and I really just wanted to prove to myself that I could commit to something for a whole month. Its hard to believe in yourself sometimes, but I did it! Hoping this belief in myself will transfer to the rest of my life :) Lots of love in, lots of love out. &lt;3",volubleperspicacious,2021-02-01T00:00:33Z,1

"This was my second 30-day yoga journey. Last year I was terrified when I realised that the last day is without Adriene&#39;s voice. But it all made sense, all the movements made sense. This year, I kept checking the video but at the same time this practice let me do the movements I&#39;ve enjoyed the most since I started practising. I could see my improvement, I could see my body taking a more playful attitude. Thank you, Adriene, and everybody for making this possible.

"Knowing that I prefer guidance I switched and did 30 save 29 for the last  BREATH practice to end on a relaxed and satisfied tone. No guidance makes me a bit tense, less this time than last January.

"Wooow combined day 29 and 30. Was an interesting one. Held some moments for longer then I&#39;m used too and found the effort with the ease, the grounding with the grace. Loved my twists and did some dancers pose into tree, and my tree swayed and I&#39;m not ashamed to say it haha. Awww Adriene and Benji Benji and all other yogis who have done this Breath series I hope you found your strength and your sense of self and will be mentioning this in a project I have coming up so shout out to Adriene and Benji Benji on March 6th 😉😁 I know that no matter what my breath will be there. And in reflection to the current situation I hope that the souls who pass on everyday due to C-19 thier last breath is a peaceful and calm one. We continue to breath for you. Happy day 30 YWA yogis.

"Wow, that was the most beautiful experience. I did Home last month, and day 30 was such a breakthrough for me, I cried the entire time. But I copied your movements, I followed the video pretty much the whole time. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I got so much from that experience last month, and that was exactly what was right for me in that moment. But today, the music moved within me, today I followed my own heart&#39;s song. It&#39;s like the yoga movements that were right for me just appeared in front of me. It was as if I was performing a dance. Every once in a while I would get a pang of anxiety or a thought would pop up like, &quot;Wait, how long have I been doing this?&quot;, &quot;Should I catch up to Adriene?&quot;, &quot;What if I forget what I did on this side when I get to the other leg?&quot;, but I just moved through them. I continued to follow my heart. A few times I would notice you were at a similar place or pace as me and I&#39;d decide to join you for a nice knocking on heaven&#39;s door, and then I slipped back into my own flow. And I expected to be sobbing through this one like I did the last. I cried in the beginning when you were speaking about new beginnings, but once I got started, all I could do was smile and laugh. I was flying. As someone who struggles with PTSD, who has been long trudging through grief, I never expected this. And I couldn&#39;t be more filled with hope. I couldn&#39;t be more grateful to you, Adriene. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Daily yoga is undoubtedly something I&#39;m going to continue for the rest of my life. I can&#39;t believe I went so long without it. Namaste and Abundant Love to All. 💓🦋✨",Kat Abrams,2021-01-31T23:48:18Z,11

"This was such an unexpected gift. Looking back, I feel each session prepared me for this one. While Adriene has been an incredible guide over these last 30-days, I felt like this session Adriene was asking us to guide the practice. I tried to toss off the fears of staying completely in sync with Adriene, and instead, stay in sync with myself and what my body was telling me. I can&#39;t say enough about the music! It was so beautifully on point. I felt powerful and strong moving through the poses and staying connected to my breath. After finishing, my partner asked me how it was and I said, &quot;It was an experience.&quot; Thanks, Adriene! Great work everyone!",Vinnie Casanova,2021-01-31T23:47:23Z,1
"Wow, what an incredible journey this has been!  I followed some of the poses for about 30 minutes and then just took a break and watched the incredible Adriene.  I made it my own and completed the practice my way!  Thank you for your encouragement, grace and  love.  I’ve followed you for a long time but this is the first time I completed a 30 day.

"This was my first 30 day journey so i was genuinely shocked when you said we were on our own for this one 😳but it turned out to be such a pleasant surprise and such a needed one. I feel like I&#39;ve gained so much in this 30 days and I don&#39;t think I went a day without wondering how something that was so good for me could feel so good in the process. This journey really helped ground me every day and gave me a chance to self-reflect and sit with my emotions which is so very important for me. The practice today was awkward at times, and I missed your voice, and I spent moments wondering if I should be idling in a pose so long, (until i remembered the flow of my breath) but it was beautiful all the same.  I only did 35 minutes of the practice today and I wasn&#39;t upset with myself about it, I just did what felt right which is such a euphoric feeling! Thank you for your wisdom and your patience and all of the work you put into these videos. They are so very important. <br />I&#39;ll be seeing you soon (: <br />Sending lots of love from the Midwest.",Marie,2021-01-31T23:46:13Z,0

What I&#39;m so shocked by is how slow I took it for myself.  I sat and breathed at the beginning and meditated on my own when that&#39;s normally so hard for me.  I did warriors and held them and held my focus and thought of my breath on my own.  I even did knocking on heaven&#39;s door!!  I always hate that one but today it felt right.

"I&#39;ve never made it to day 30 of a YWA journey, and I&#39;ve never done a freestyle flow before. I was considering skipping, doing a different video, or watching Adriene the whole time. But I decided to follow my own path and I&#39;m so happy. Before doing a wide legged forward fold, I caught Adriene looking at the camera and smiling and thought, &quot;I&#39;m doing great Adriene, don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; I teared up when the outro music played and Adriene bowed. These classes have been so transformative physically, mentally, and spiritually. Thank you for this journey Adriene.",Jennifer Dennin,2021-01-31T23:44:29Z,0
"Thank you so much Adrienne, you are an angel. I am in tears and I cried the whole practice today. When you said you were gonna take your mic off today I felt such a pang of panic in my heart as I knew this was the end and you were letting us go, on our own. It felt scary, and sacred. It felt generous, and empowering, and I started panicking in my head because I thought &quot;how am I gonna do this without her&quot;? This is how I have come to rely on your voice, your guidance, your kindness, your empathy, your presence in the past 30 days. You have brought true light and love into my life and you have showed me how it&#39;s already inside of me, and today was the day where you revealed to me that big secret, that I had it inside all along, and I could do this without you. Today, I could see my own strength so clearly, maybe for the first time. I know these are big words and they might sound crazy, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not the only one who feels this way. I&#39;m practicing yoga since a few years, and I have never really experienced an opening of the heart like I did today. I&#39;m feeling very emotional right now. With everything happening in the world, in my life, in others life, all the misery, the sadness there is right now, the desperation, the fear... I am just so grateful I got to experience these 30 days with you and the other thousands of people around the world. What a precious gift. I am so humbled by the generosity, the purity of your heart. I feel so full of hope, of gratitude, and love. I feel that I&#39;ve got this. I feel that we&#39;ve got this. We will get through.

"Thank you Adriene for being my guide back to my regular practice! I am so grateful for the transformation this journey facilitated for me- these 30 days were the perfect way to start the year.

Excellent series Adriene. Thank you so so much. I have enjoyed everyday. I will absolutely continue daily so thanks too for the February playlist. <br />I didn’t expect to feel emotional at the end. This has changed my mo around yoga. Thank you 💞🙌🏼xx,Jo Beak,2021-01-31T23:39:40Z,0
"Slightly dreaded being cast adrift again on day 30, I knew this was coming. I managed better than before, but I really depend on Adriene’s voice to tell me to breathe as much as anything! I don’t usually look at my iPad mini in practice as I can’t really see it without glasses, which ain’t happening in a practice. I suggest two versions for future day 30, one with guidance, one without. This would be so inclusive for many people too. That aside, I loved Breath, my first time following a current Adriene project, and felt really involved. Top quality and yummy. Oh adding greetings to all from West London 🙏",Paula Pardoe,2021-01-31T23:39:26Z,30
"Here&#39;s how I do day 30: I start sitting like she does and I shut eyes a breathe for a bit. Then I think about my current favorite pose and start working up to that- usually it&#39;s tree pose- so a few sun salutations to warm up and then I work on my balance and voila! Tree pose time. Then I&#39;ll glance at Adrienne and see what she&#39;s up to. Warrior 2? Cool. I&#39;ll work up to that- down dog, high lunge, warrior one, warrior two- oh I like standing wide legged forward fold, Ill do that for a bit! I just mess around like that. Find what feels good. lol My practice is totally different from hers but we&#39;re all practicing together.",Gretchen Auten,2021-02-01T19:35:20Z,1
"I agree, I love these last days with a longer practice to see how far I&#39;ve come but find I crane myself into bad position to see the screen as not quite ready to flow on own and breathing goes out the window. Doesn&#39;t have to be an in-depth guidance just enough to know when changing positions. 💕",Sarah Wade,2021-02-01T17:44:58Z,5
"I also abandon my glasses for practice, I definitely missed the guidance",Katie Massie,2021-02-01T01:12:31Z,5
"I agree, a practice with just the pose names would be really helpful to those who don&#39;t typically look at the screen or who have vision problems.",Prosateuse,2021-02-01T00:52:40Z,6

"I&#39;ve always been a big fan of resting post-practice and reading everyone&#39;s lovely comments, but I had to leave my first one here. I was honestly very nervous coming to the mat today, knowing your mic was off! But I heard a little voice in my head as we started together telling me to catch the wave of my breath and I started to move. (Yes, there were a few breaks just to sit in child&#39;s pose and have a big old cry!) <br /><br />Thank you, Adriene, and the community, for giving me the tools to achieve something I never thought I could commit myself to. Accomplishing this 30 day journey is bittersweet, but it&#39;s left me asking one question - what awesome thing can me, my body and my breath take on next?",Lucy,2021-01-31T23:37:38Z,0

"Not one to comment on the internet, but thank you for this gift. I had my second baby six months ago today and it was my goal to recommit to my yoga practice in the new year. You made that possible. I am so grateful to you for sharing your talents with me and the world. This has helped me-- and I&#39;m sure so many others-- feel less isolated during such crazy, challenging times. I am committed to continuing my practice moving forward and I thank you again for helping me build strength and a sense of self. It is odd to feel so connected to someone you&#39;ve never met, but here&#39;s hoping that changes someday. Thank you, Adriene!!",Samantha Francis-Taylor,2021-01-31T23:34:59Z,0

"First 30 days of YWA for me so I was pretty stressed and lost when I heard it was a session in silence... I couldn&#39;t trust myself enough to go completely freestyle but it was a wonderful session, just hearing the sound of my breath and seeing that I could kinda anticipate the movements and the rythm on the screen. I felt very emotional at the end and cried for the first time in a yoga practice! I&#39;m so proud of us all for this journey, very eager to continue 2021 with you! Thank you so much Adriene, you&#39;re a wonderful teacher.

"I never realized that the last day was without the microphone, mostly because, I never made it all the way through the 30 days before today. This is the first year I’ve completed the entire month in the last four or five years since I discovered the channel. I made it all the way through today’s practice and did moves I could barely attempt a month ago, maybe not as pretty or graceful as Adriene, but I could do it. Wonderful!

"I come from a religious tradition that unwittingly taught me to abandon the wisdom/spirituality of my body, and to find such things elsewhere. When I recognized that harm, I cynically abandoned spirituality altogether (oops).

"January was a tough month, but having this time set aside for myself every day helped me conquer it! I have attempted yoga without any verbal guidance before, but only for short periods of time. This was a challenge for me because I wanted to follow along perfectly, but once I realized that as long as I did what felt good it was very freeing!

I shed a little tear at the end of the video when I starting looking back at my screen and saw you bowing (a little voice in my head were like noooooo no outro, don&#39;t go Adriene!). It&#39;s the third year in a row I&#39;m following this journey and it&#39;s been healing and transformative each time. I could write tons of words and still not be able to really describe the preciousness of all this so I&#39;m going to say just that: thank you from the bottom of my heart.

"Wow this was such an emotional practice. About 5 months ago I googled free yoga  and found a site that I tried but only 1 session was free and the rest were locked. Their payed videos were expensive. I was so  annoyed I  gave up . Then about 3 months ago I googled again  and found you. I did a few days of your yoga for beginners video and then started 30 days of yoga .I went all the way through and then started your 30 days of home. I finished that and then saw the Breath series . I never missed a day. Today I missed your sweet voice but knew you were there with me and you had my back. Writing this is making me tear up. You are an angel, and I am so grateful to you for sharing all these video&#39;s with us  the time you have put in to this is  amazing . I am 64 and I wish I had found you years ago. You have given me  so many gifts and tools and I am so grateful. I will begin the February calendar tomorrow because I&#39;m sticking with you for the rest of my life.

When I started to push myself up to a seat I opened my eyes a little bit and saw you in the exact same position. What a strange connection, and it filled me with gratitude and a sense of really practicing with you and all the other people on this journey. I&#39;ve been doing yoga with you since I started my practice six years.

"I loved each day of this Breathe journey.  I think I understand better (this year, finally) why you like to do a silent session at the end.  I take it to be a way to remind me that I can do yoga on my own.  Which is an important thing to know.

"I&#39;ll be honest. The last 30 days were hard for me. Most days, I didn&#39;t even want to get on my mat. My body isn&#39;t as strong as it used to be and poses that used to be simple were so challenging. I had difficulty finding stillness and there were so many days where I almost gave up. But I was determined to stick with it to the end (I haven&#39;t made it through one of these challenges since 2017). I had to make modifications and take breaks during some of the videos, but I made it. Every day, I got one step closer. I&#39;m proud of myself. I didn&#39;t meet what I thought my &quot;expectations&quot; should be, but I showed up and I did the work. My body might not be as strong as it once was- but it got me through the last 30 days. And I&#39;m proud of it.<br /><br />I loved reading through y&#39;all&#39;s comments after each practice- this is truly a beautiful community. We did it! <br /><br />Thank you as always, Adriene for putting so much work and your heart and soul into each one of these videos. You are truly changing lives.

"30 straight days of yoga culminating in a self led session! I am overwhelmed with pride and gratitude which spilled out of my eyes as though I witnessed a birth or death. In many ways these past 30 days have been exactly that, a dying of doubt and excuses and a new born sense of strength, resilience and commitment to self. I am thankful and most grateful beyond adequate expression to Adriene for the daily invitation and support that encouraged me to keep showing up and saying yes to such a glorious journey. Much love!",Rob Militmore,2021-01-31T23:10:38Z,0
"I love you and this whole 30 day journey, but I was very disappointed in this last video. :( I felt unprepared for the hands off approach. Looking at the screen to understand the sequence took me out of the moment through the sequence. The music just didn&#39;t match my practice and often distracted me from my breath. I loved the other 29 days, but Begin left me feeling frustrated and sad.",Megan Yingst,2021-01-31T23:09:42Z,1

"Thank you!! I was so happy to feel this self-guided practice. I glanced over from time to time and either saw that you were doing something I had done earlier, or something I hadn’t done yet and hadn’t yet thought to do, so it definitely helped me get all the way through this long practice, but I was so heartened to see that I could do it on my own, without specific instruction the whole time. This was a great 30 days, and I plan on continuing after, taking some time, even if just a few minutes, each morning to feel my breath and my body. Thank you so much.",Autumn Riley,2021-01-31T23:08:33Z,0
"Wow. At first I thought 50 mins, so long!! But I pressed play and the idea of freestyle was fun, I ended up doing quite a few different things, learnt from all the previous classes, with all her little tips in my mind at each pose. I didn&#39;t think I would be able to do this, make all the moves flow, but then I realised that it has come to the end of the video and there&#39;s still a bunch of things I want to do, which I didn&#39;t realise I would want to. So back to the mat, to finish my session . I&#39;ve really enjoyed this and I hope everyone else has too, stay safe. X",Maria Louise,2021-01-31T23:07:32Z,0

It was an honor to be here and  keep showing up on the mat each day with y&#39;all. I kept listening to my breath off the mat as well and doing the breath techniques you taught us in stressful situations, and it really helped.

"What an honour it has been. Thank you for your careful, kind guidance today, and throughout the last 30 days. I was talking to someone the other day about breath...and that in itself was a new for me! Talking about breath?! But more so, it made me realize how many times in the last month I have paid attention to the quality of my breath when I am stressed, or happy, or tired. That is such a treasure that I take away from this month. Stronger yes, but more able to connect to the breath, that I truly believe was breathed into us by our loving God. It makes me feel closer to God&#39;s Spirit in me, and helps me to remember I am never alone. Grateful.",Darren Lof,2021-01-31T22:58:28Z,0

Thank you so much for this journey Adriene! Throughout the process and doing videos with you for the last three years I have at least once a practice found myself saying “Adriene coming in clutch!” aloud as you guided us through a movement that seemed so perfectly suited to what my body or spirit needed on that day. Exploring this every day this month with you helped me realize that - while I am sure you are a little psychic ;) - it wasn’t always that you magically knew what I needed but that my body and spirit was doing the work to find something that was already in the practice and suit it to myself! I have been trying to give myself more credit through this process and to take the leap of faith and practice with no guidance today was a perfect way to round off this journey! Namaste ❤️,Sarah B,2021-01-31T22:55:02Z,0
"Voiceover practices are my favorites normally, and I always look forward to these freestyle practices. But as soon as I started this practice, I felt a little nervous and sad that I wouldn&#39;t be hearing your cues, Adriene. Not because I felt that I couldn&#39;t follow on my own or move in my own way, but because I was afraid of getting &quot;out of step&quot; with you. This has been such a time of disconnect for everyone, and this series (and this channel, and your work in general) has created a place of unity and safety. As weird as it sounds, I felt like not hearing your voice would make me lose track of my pace, and that we wouldn&#39;t be practicing &quot;together.&quot; But as you said, we have the tools to cultivate our own practice and to move in our own breath, and the intuition to feel what&#39;s coming next in the flow. It didn&#39;t take me long to appreciate the silence, the beautiful music, and the opportunity to be led by you (and my breath) in a nonverbal way.<br />Many, many thanks to you and the rest of the YWA team for creating something that has helped millions of people across the globe. This channel has been such a positive place for me and something that has helped me appreciate my life and my body when times are good and when times are bad. I wish I could give back in kind what has been given to me (and so many others), because it&#39;s been nothing but kindness and goodness. Thank you always, for everything.💜",Emily Benoit,2021-01-31T22:53:57Z,0

"This is only my second year of completing this 30 Day Yoga Journey but the first where I have managed to show up for myself every single day. Some days I was able to reach the mat with bundles of energy and enthusiasm whilst on other days I nearly didn&#39;t make it. But I did. We all did. In different ways and constricted by different schedules and time-scales but we did it.<br />It&#39;s nice to be able to compare how I felt this year vs the last. Last year I missed many days and, honestly, ended up completing the last section of &quot;Home&quot; as if it were an afterthought (not to say it wasn&#39;t still an amazing experience).<br />The main difference I&#39;ve noted with this practice is that my awareness of emotion has improved dramatically and I am (slowly!) learning to trust my intuition, which, as a constant self-doubter and walking ball of anxiety, is huge for me! This practice felt sooo different from the others, I can remember last year struggling to work without Adriene&#39;s cues and becoming frustrated with myself if I fell behind. But this session was entirely different. Quite a few times when I took a glance at my screen I was shocked to find Adriene in the same position I thought I had (randomly) moved in to! I&#39;ve never felt a connection like that before. When I felt uncertainty and panic rise up if the screen was vastly ahead of me, I was able to slow myself down and just breathe.<br />I don&#39;t think yoga is quite an everyday thing for me (yet) but I want to commit to showing up for myself more. My favourite mantra from this is 100%, &quot;everything is as it should be.&quot; I never thought such a simple phrase could be so comforting. <br />Thanks for sharing the tears, laughter and sing-a-longs! <br />Namaste &lt;3",theeIzbeee,2021-01-31T22:38:03Z,0

Thank you Adriene for inspiring, motivating, and guiding me to become more in touch with myself and a stronger person, both mentally and physically. You are much appreciated for your work, Adriene!

"Congratulations and thank you to everyone that went on this journey with me!  And most especially, thank you to our phenomenal leader, Adriene. This was a beautiful flow. Unfortunately, I feel like I was unable to fully relax and enjoy it because I had such anticipatory stress. I love the no mic practice, but wonder if you would consider doing a voice over with simple commands. I found myself constantly breaking the pose too early to look up and see if I had missed something or holding a pose too long and rushing to catch up.

"I wish that there were a narrated version, as not everyone can see what you are doing but would still like to follow along. Maybe there could be 2 versions with one being a narrated video. I really like your videos because you frequently mention that not all bodies are the same and not everyone has the same abilities. That is the reason why after hating most yoga I am getting into it. Your classes are awesome and very aware to individual needs. So it would be so great to see there be an accessibility option for the vision impaired and anyone else who finds your voice the reason they keep going.",Jazmine Peck,2021-01-31T22:35:06Z,15
"I also really enjoyed the flow of this practice and even the length (for some days). Hearing all the cues in my head and discovering how much I&#39;ve learned was wonderful. But I also found it difficult to look up to the laptop from downward dog to see what was coming next. Would love even minimal narration on this -- even just &quot;step right foot back / come to the front of your mat&quot;. In previous years I practiced only with the telephone, and then found these silent practices totally impossible to follow along with. I remember giving up in the middle and just finding another practice to do instead.",Sharon Tslil,2021-02-01T18:48:11Z,0
"hmmm, offering an idea to watch it as you sit comfortably maybe journal as the entire video was a piece of art for me. Then, step on your mat and move in a way that &quot;feels good,&quot; either re-watching or just putting on calming music.",Carr Sick,2021-02-01T17:39:50Z,0
"I agree a narrated version of some kind would have been good for some of us. I must admit I didn&#39;t understand the last day at all - I can imagine unguided practice working in person, maybe in a studio but I wanted to follow along and I couldn&#39;t do it without some verbal cues",Richard Allaway,2021-02-01T17:07:46Z,0
"I don&#39;t know guys, I kind of dread the last day because I miss her voice- the music was JAMM&#39;IN but I miss her mouth sounds",Kathi,2021-01-31T22:34:41Z,0
"Wasn&#39;t sure what to make of this unguided session, but I just went with the flow and did what I thought my body needed (lots of twists as it happens!), while Adriene did her thing. Once when I glanced across we were in the same pose and I felt weirdly moved. I&#39;m working round an  injury, so I did a shorter practice and then watched Adriene for the last 25 mins. What a journey, thanks to you all for sharing it and making this such a warm community, and thanks of course to Adriene and Benji xxx",Eleanor H,2021-01-31T22:34:38Z,1
Anyone else get emotional when hearing past 30-day theme songs?? This is my third year of finishing it and a wonderful opportunity to see how far I&#39;ve come every Jan 31st. Thank you Adriene for your kindness in creating this community  &lt;3,Sarah Pollock,2021-01-31T22:34:37Z,2
"I usually rebel against any kind of routine but I have enjoyed yoga with Adriene so much I thought I&#39;d give the 30 day Breath Journey a try. I also think I&#39;m low on will power so figured it would be a good test. I did it every day, even when my hands and wrists were sore, and I have noticed I am more flexible and look more sculpted in my arms and legs...still working on other parts ;) You have a great personality Adriene and I especially enjoy how you amuse yourself with silly innuendos in the midst of a deep philosophy! Thank you from my heart to yours!",Alicia Bomhoff,2021-01-31T22:34:07Z,0

I have now completed 90 consecutive days of practice with Adriene!

"What a lovely journey! This is my second year in a row completing a 30-day yoga challenge and I couldn&#39;t be more proud of myself and this beautiful community. The last day is always a scary day but also a fun one where you just get to do whatever your body needs at that moment. I&#39;ve learned so much about my inner self and my body through yoga, and I&#39;m looking forward to exploring and learning more. A &quot;thank you&quot; wouldn&#39;t even be enough to explain how grateful I am to you Adriene, and of course to all the other beautiful people who constantly share the love on this platform.

I&#39;ve been doing yoga on and off since December 2018. I decided to take on this challenge to see what it would feel like to do yoga consistently for a full 30 days and I&#39;m very excited to try doing this all year. Didn&#39;t do so great without instruction today but it was so fun to watch you transition seamlessly through the positions. I hope to acquire such grace in my practice.

"Thank you Adriene...  I’ll admit I was pumped at the beginning. I was like, ‘I got this’. I was all, ‘look me and Adriene are doing yoga together’. Then about halfway through the wheel came off. I definitely ran out. So I just kept trying and eventually made it to the end. Not really the victorious home run I was looking for but thanks for being with me everyone. It’s definitely amazing to consider everyone in this community practicing together their own thing. Namaste! 🙏",Monica Ries,2021-01-31T22:27:40Z,0
"yes baby! we did it! 🧡<br />I was so busy all day that I could only have time for yoga before I go to sleep in the middle of the night. but I cannot describe my excitement during the day for the practise! 🥰 I was literally dying to do it! The practise was emotional, I couldn&#39;t focus very much while doing the movements because I had all kinds of feelings in my heart. I think the most important feeling was peace and happiness. Maybe I have never devoted so much time to myself in my life, now I realize how beautiful it is. 🌼 thank you a thousand times for everything Adriene and all of you!

"I can&#39;t believe it! I actually did it! Thank you so much, Adriene! At the beginning of this journey, I didn&#39;t think I could do it. I have to admit, that I skipped day four, because I had a very bad mental health day, but I did the program the next day and after that didn&#39;t skip a single practice. Evan if I felt bad on some days, I managed to not give up. I can&#39;t express how much it means to me that I did this and how thankful I am. Thank you so much, Adriene, for being such a amazing, motivating and uplifting person and thank you to everyone else, who was part of this beautiful journey.

"I can just feel gratitude for you Adriene and for this beautiful community where i feel that i belong... This is a practice I&#39;ll return to, everything you said in the beggining is a daily reminder, thank you! I first started doing yoga here in the beginning of quarentine, i did your first 30 days journey and it completely changed everything in myself, i needed that so much in that time... And recently I&#39;ve been through a tough experience where i got completely broken and your BREATH journey helped me to pick all the pieces together in myself by simply breathing in and breathing out (even though it could be so hard sometimes), it helped me in my healing process, it made the healing real. It&#39;s just too much feelings to put into words and i think it can look confusing... Basically all I&#39;m trying to say is THANK YOU Adriene and friends that did it with me WE DID IT and yeah it&#39;s the best way to restart, the best way to BEGIN 2021! Light and love for everyone, may we all continue in this eternal journey of yoga!",marianne,2021-01-31T22:13:08Z,0

"What a journey it&#39;s been. I&#39;ve done one other 30 day series, HOME, and when I reached the final day of no instructions, I was so bewildered. Haha! I had so much resistance and felt the need to &quot;follow,&quot; and &quot;get it right.&quot; After moving through 30 days of breath, I finally realized what it feels like to follow your own breath. To listen to your own inner voice. To march to the beat of your own drum. Thank you, Adriene. I get it now. <br /><br />I also began the practice thinking, &quot;Jeeze, 50 minutes? That&#39;s a long time to keep going on my own.&quot; I got to the end and couldn&#39;t believe it when I heard the theme music going out. I WANTED TO KEEP GOING! <br /><br />I finished on my own - in absolute silence, except for, of course, my own breath. (Sorry this is a novel, but I&#39;m flooded with feelings and thoughts and who better to share them with than this awesome, supportive community!) I watched the flurries falling outside and heard my dog sigh. I felt my heart beat. I smelled the candles I had lit. I felt the sweat on the back of my neck. I knew I was exactly where I should be. <br /><br />Thank you for everything, friends. It&#39;s been an honor.",Rachel Clausen,2021-01-31T22:10:44Z,0
"I was faithful with every day and I really felt like I made progress. Unfortunately for this last one, I had to stop 15 minutes in because I was getting a cramp in my neck trying to look at the screen. No matter what position I put my mat, it made no difference. I can&#39;t do this without prompts. I get that this is &quot;the tradition&quot; and all but I just got frustrated. It was a disappointing end to the 30 days I invested in. I&#39;m not giving up. I plan to start the February calendar tomorrow. 👍",Cheryl Heemstra,2021-01-31T22:09:27Z,4

"I cried this morning while I was reading both letters from you. It is so beautiful what we all doing at this community. We are one. That is all that matters. While we were doing todays practice I laughed because today is like taking an exam except there is no bad or good grade. Every move we do, it a plus for your &quot;grade&quot; which in this case its explore what feels good for us. <br />I feel so lucky to be here and I am feeling more than welcome. Thank you every single one of you who showed up. We really did this😭 <br />At the top of January, I was at my lowest in a really long time. Cried for one week straight  but now with all the &quot;homework&quot; I have taken, I&#39;m full to continue do life and I&#39;m very excited to continue what we have built here. As Adriene said today, I wrote my expectations for February and I am going to work off the mat a little more. Find kindness with the people I am close with and don&#39;t put bad energy between us.<br />Again, no words can&#39;t describe what I feel for you Adriene and how thankful I am for what i have taken from you. Thank you so so much. You are loved. We are all loved. ❤",Μαρία Καρπάθη,2021-01-31T22:07:42Z,0
"I felt so humbled when you said you were going to take your mic off and practice &#39;with&#39; us today... then scared that I couldn&#39;t trust myself.. and then I realised you had taught us so beautifully and I have come so far...  and although I spent the first 5 minutes balling my eyes out, I realised this is the first loving thing I&#39;ve ever done for myself.  Your words were in my head as reminded myself &quot;you are strong, darling, and you are worthy&quot;.  And there was my precious breath.<br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart - to you Adriene, and to all who have taken this journey.  We are all strong, worthy, and loved.  Namaste. 🤍",Gabi Terihaj,2021-01-31T22:07:13Z,5
I had a hard time following your postures-watching the screen and doing the movements.  Became disconnected to my breath and body as a result. I began again by letting go of your postures and did my own yoga. This allowed me to reconnect to my body.,Debbie Gorenstein,2021-01-31T22:07:09Z,1
"Wow! I did it. and I know so many others did it too. I tried last year but just couldn&#39;t. Today while I was doing my farm chores. I thought about the concept of showing up for me. I show up for the animals, I show up for work, I show up all kinds of duties. I showed up for me for 30 days straight. It was hard. I&#39;m not used to doing that. It will take more practice... but I have many days ahead of me. And bonus I feel some new muscles in my core as I too like to call it my belly! Love to all ofyou!",Susan Odom,2021-01-31T22:05:28Z,0

I started yoga with adrienne last year with home series and i loved it alot but when i came to day 30 i didn&#39;t know that day 30 was your own day and there is no voice and i wasn&#39;t comfortable while doing the practice and looking at the screen trying to do what adrienne do especially this was the beginningof practicing yoga.<br />Actually this year i did breath without skipping any day and on time unlike home and the lovely community on this channel and facebook group motivated me and hopefully someone mentioned on the group that day 30 is your own day that you create your own flow and i was looking forward to it because i love to practice on music and i am here to say that i loved this practice very much and i managed to it successfully and i am very happy about it and i was happy that i was proceeding adrienne with the poses then i saw here do the pose after me and actually i was hearing adrienne sound in the pose like she used to say in child pose breathe 5 times here.<br />I am here to celebrate my progress so far that now i am capable of doing my own flow and i wanted to thank adriene for being such an amazing person and tutor and i want to thank all of you. namaste❤❤❤,salma samra,2021-01-31T22:04:24Z,0

These free form practices are always so fun once I manage to just try to be in the moment and not worry about how much time we have left etc. I found some beautiful sequences and fun transitions that I’ve never done before, and even threw in a wild thing and a crow!<br />Thank you again Adriene for this precious time, and thank you to everyone here!

The last two times I managed to get through to day 30 I failed to get through the video on my own. This time I told myself I would at least try again. The 50 minutes were intimidating but actually time flew by. I couldn&#39;t believe the video was through and I still had a couple more poses in my mind that I would have liked to do. I must admit I had a big  proud smile on my face when I saw Adrienne put her hands to her third eye for Namaste!

"I&#39;ve never commented on a video of yours before, Adriene, despite following for months starting with HOME last september, so I wanted to finish today off with stepping out of my comfort zone, like some other awesome person in the comments mentioned.  This is my first 30 day journey and even though I missed a couple days, I always caught up and did today before bed while very tired. As usual, it was exactly what I needed. It wasn&#39;t as smooth as I&#39;d like it to be, but that is ok. It&#39;s all a learning experience and I really feel like this is just the beginning. I want to thank you, Adriene, from the bottom of my heart for what you give to the world. And thank you to everyone else on this journey, I really enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s comments.

It&#39;s okay, though, I did another practice and then came in again at the end. I&#39;m grateful for the opportunity to join you all this month.",Kate Sarfaty,2021-01-31T21:36:26Z,0
Thank you so so much for sharing your time and energy with us and for helping to make the world a better place. <br />To rephrase you: The light in you helps me to find the light in me. I&#39;ll see you on the next 30.,Cat Cat,2021-01-31T21:36:20Z,0

"Adriene already had me crying at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwyEtS_7OQ&amp;t=2m20s"">2:20</a>, without even speaking a word. Just with a smile... <br />Thank you so much for everything, dear Adriene. You truly make this world a better place.<br />And thank you, EVERYONE, for practicing with me and for taking this time for yourselves. I thought about you during my practice! &lt;3 <br />(Also, this was my first time practicing without instructions, and I enjoyed it a lot!)",Jana K,2021-01-31T21:34:36Z,0
"I was nervous that I wouldn&#39;t be able to practice for 50 minutes without Adriene guiding me. But once I started I could hear her voice helping me into positions, and I followed my breath -  Adriene, you have taught us so much in 30 days! I didn&#39;t look at the screen during the practice and the most incredible thing was that as I lay in foetal position and started to make my way up to sitting, and to finish, I opened my eyes and looked to see Adriene doing exactly the same thing. I am blown away by that synchronicity. Thank you, Adriene. Well done, everyone! And see you tomorrow! x",Susie Riddell,2021-01-31T21:34:23Z,0
"While I&#39;m not one to comment on videos, I felt compelled to after today&#39;s practice. When I would glance up and see Adriene smile at the camera as if it was her way of silently giving encouragement, it inspired me to keep pushing forward. By the time practice ended, I was in tears. This was my first yoga journey and the best thing I could have ever done for myself. Thank you SO MUCH, your impact is so positively felt &lt;3",Sydne Dresser,2021-01-31T21:34:02Z,0
"I started and ended this video with tears. Tears of joy, appreciation, love, and pride. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever done something like this and I&#39;m so glad I did!

"I am so proud of everyone who completed this 30 day journey! Especially those of you who were completely new to yoga before &#39;Breath&#39;. Adriene, I absolutely loved this. It was the most challenging practice I&#39;ve done in the 2 years I&#39;ve been following your videos. I smiled so hard when we started &#39;knocking on heavens door&#39; and I could even hear you saying &#39;come on, if I can do this on youtube, you can do it at home&#39; and &#39;heel toe dosey doe your feet together - really together&#39;. It&#39;s crazy how connected we can feel to someone without having ever met in person. As my third January 30 day journey with you ends, I&#39;m excited for what yoga awaits in 2021.

"Thank you so much for this amazing journey ! <br />It felt so good, it made me gain strenght, flexibility, focus, peace, and so much more !<br />I&#39;ve reconnected with my breath, heart, body, mind, soul, myself<br />You&#39;re an amazing teacher, and I believe an amazing human being, and so are all the people that have been part of this journey.<br />It could been hard, challeging, and we could felt tired, lazy, angry, but we did it, we shows up for ourself ! We can be proud.<br />It such an honor to being a part of this wonderful community.<br />As there&#39;s a new beginning in every ending, it may be the end of this great expreirence, but it opens to a larger commitement, so I will continue practicing all year long but I already look forward to see you next year !<br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart",Célia Wang,2021-01-31T21:30:11Z,0

"I&#39;ve tried the 30 days programmes a few years now and never actually did the last day of any - I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to keep focus, would get hung up on following what Adriene was doing etc. This time - I did it! For the first half I found I was unintentionally syncing up with Adriene - I went in saying, I&#39;ll do what feels right for me and not try to follow her without her voice to guide, but it like she was one step ahead of me every time I looked up. Half-way through though I felt my legs and hips and lower back wanted more love - so I parted ways with Adriene and used the &#39;vocabulary&#39; she&#39;s taught me! Every now and then I&#39;d look up and see something Adriene was doing and think ooh, yes yummy I might do that in a moment. I&#39;m just so proud of being able to come to the mat in that new, mindful mindset able to guide myself. Thank you Adriene x",Nicola Todhunter,2021-01-31T21:29:55Z,0
"I’m over the moon to have completed and been a part of this 30 day yoga journey with all you special people. Day 30 allowed me to put into practice everything I’ve learnt over these heartwarming days. At first, I was a little unsure and kept looking up at Adriene for reassurance but within 15 minutes I came into this tranquil flow with the music and I was in sync. I’m so proud of myself for being able to complete every move, like the balancing pose and crow pose (even if it was for a micro second, ha) Slowly lowering from plank has gone from torture to like hovering my body weight and with control lowering myself down, -now a pleasure) Throughout the entire practice I kept getting snippets of Adriene’s teachings coming to me, and words of advice. ‘Come on, you got this.’ ‘Whisper to yourself, I am strong.’ ‘Gather strength from your core.’ ‘Lower down with control.’ ‘Tap into that inner smile’ haha I could go on and on. I even smiled at the same time as Adriene when we did the smacking the but move 😁 Adriene, from my heart to yours, thank you 🙏🏼 You are the best yoga teacher and teacher in general, I’ve ever had xxxx ❤️",Wonder Woman,2021-01-31T21:29:21Z,1

"I&#39;ve done every practice so far but I&#39;m so scared of doing this one, I&#39;ve been putting it off all day. How are we supposed to know what to do for 50 mins unguided? Does anyone have words of comfort/advice?",Kaytishu,2021-01-31T21:28:19Z,0
"I’d watch her for a few seconds and then catch up, so when you’re in downwards dog you know what’s coming next. A lot of the practice is resting and is slow so you can catch up easily, and by about 20 mins you will know what’s coming next. Good luck",Wonder Woman,2021-01-31T21:32:35Z,1

"I finally finished a 30 Day Journey! I&#39;ve been doing YWA for the past year and a half off and on, but this month I was able to stick to it and complete every day! I was super nervous going into this Day 30 and I must admit I did get lost a couple times, but thanks to Adriene&#39;s patient guidance through the other days of this Journey I was able to find a flow that worked for me and got me back on track!  I&#39;m so proud of the progress I&#39;ve made, from the little things like reaching my heels ever closer to the ground in downward dog, to the bigger things like holding my crow for five whole seconds 😂. Thank you to Adriene and this community for being one of the most loving and patient on the internet! Love and light 💛💛💛",immortanjoy,2021-01-31T21:26:05Z,0

"I love your practices and I loved the whole series up to yesterday so I was disappointed to realize (and remember from last year) that the capstone is a silent practice. I understand the WHY but I am severely myopic and prefer to take my glasses off and do yoga mostly with my eyes closed, listening for cues. It helps me sink deeper into the practice, so needing to wear my glasses AND look frequently at the screen was really frustrating.<br /><br />I&#39;m so grateful for what you did here but I did want to share this feedback as I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling frustrated with the silent practice (I have been sharing regularly about the 30-day on Instagram and have heard the same from others).",Christine Koh,2021-01-31T21:24:00Z,0

"Look at us sweating on Day 30... or was it just me?!?! It was a beautiful practice and a gentle reminder to listen to our inner voice. It was never about being in sync like a yoga robot.

Today, I decided to just go for it and not feel the need to follow where you went today.

"I started practicing yoga about a year ago and couldn’t have done it without this series. I’ve gone back and done 2 of the other 30 day journeys, and I truly appreciate these. But ... and please don’t hate me ... the 30th silent day doesn’t work for me. I’m not relaxed. I’m constantly checking the screen to see if I need to transition, did I miss something, torquing my head in weird ways to see that screen. I often do much of a practice with my eyes closed, so this is 180 degrees from what I normally do. I’m a true fan, but following the FWFG tenets, day 30 isn’t for me. Sorry.",Kevin Jones,2021-01-31T21:20:32Z,0
"Dear Adriene, I would like to thank You so much for what You&#39;re doing for so many people around the 🌎. You are a true inspiration for me. To be completely honest, in the previous years I haven&#39;t been able to complete 30 days. I don&#39;t know why. Now I think I just wasn&#39;t ready. But this year I woke up at 6:30 am (Poland) with joy and anticipation to start my day with You, yoga and Benji 😊 And today for the first time I complete the 30 days so for me, it&#39;s some milestone, and I am proud of myself. I have my limitations. For the whole of my life I had problems with Achilles. My muscles aren&#39;t strong enough (yet) to do everything. But I tried and do my best. And now with Your help and guidance, I will try to complete 335 days of yoga. And I know I can do it because I am strong. See You tomorrow! Namaste 🙏🏻❤️🇵🇱🎉",Ktototaka,2021-01-31T21:20:21Z,1

"I did one of the other 30 day programmes last year but spaced it out. When it came to day 30 I was disappointed and only did a few moves before giving up. This time, I have done each session every day (minus one ill day) and again I wasn&#39;t looking forward to day 30 as I knew what was coming. I showed up, determined to try. I did 25mins of practice! The last 30 days this has given me something to focus on, some routine to each evening and got me moving. It&#39;s given me time for me, to relax, to forget, to unwind, to breathe! I haven&#39;t enjoyed every session, but I stopped clock watching after day three and have always come away feeling calmer and more &#39;at peace&#39;. When a lot of things feel odd, weird, unsettling and unknown right now, this has been perfectly timed. Thank you Adriene ❤️",EJH4593,2021-01-31T21:16:45Z,0

I overall loved this Breath practice and felt it was so holistic and helped me strengthen inside and out. I must be honest; however, that I realized through this last session, that I like instruction. I found myself not breathing well and struggling with either following Andrienne (and straining my neck)...or getting flustered with what to do next.  I may be the only one who felt this way, but I was hoping for more feelings of unity and closure which was hard to accomplish when I felt I was kinda &quot;on my own&quot;.  I would suggest maybe having a silent option, along with a guided one when completing a journey.  Or maybe, it was just too long for me. I probably could have felt more confident if I was guiding myself through 20 or so minutes.  But again...this does not undermine that great experience I had overall. I printed my bridge calendar and intend to continue. I appreciate Adrienne so much.  I&#39;m just not confident enough to flow through 55 minutes with no instruction (yet).  Thanks for this wonderful experience.",Adina Middleman,2021-01-31T21:16:05Z,0

"I have so enjoyed this journey! I feel stronger, more confident, and more in tune with myself and my world. I still can’t do crow pose, but maybe one day I’ll get there 😊 I loved coming to the mat every day and seeing how each session unfolded and how it made me feel. And, I kept my promise to myself to do the 30 days all in a row! Thank you, Adriene, and thank you every other yogi following along. We are all stronger and more beautiful together! 🙏🏽💙 Namaste",Aubrey Walter,2021-01-31T21:14:14Z,1
"This wasn&#39;t my first 30 day journey and I found myself looking forward to it and a little excited before today&#39;s practice. I found I wanted to spend a few more minutes on the mat after the video. I took it slow, at my own pace and really enjoyed my own flow.

This was a beautiful practice. I feel so at peace with myself ( and a bit sweaty!). Ready for another week of lockdown and homeschooling. Breathe and breathe and breathe. It’s all starts with the breath. Even my young daughters now take a breath before doing anything hard. Thank you. ❤️,Katy Martin,2021-01-31T21:11:27Z,4
"Thank you so much for this 30 day journey Adriene. I couldn’t have asked for a better teacher or friend to guide me through. I feel stronger, calmer and more connected to the present, it really has been life changing. I’ve felt for a long time that yoga is something that I should do to help me be more flexible, but this 30 days has shown me that it is so much more than that and I now look forward to joining you on the mat every day, I now want to do it, so a big shift from feeling I should do it to actually wanting to do it. Thank you to you and your team for making it so accessible, I can only imagine the amount of work that is put into bringing this to everyone. Thank you, thank you, so much 🙏",Lynn Anderson,2021-01-31T21:11:12Z,0

"Every bit of the turning point I&#39;m experiencing in my life right now was reflected on the mat today, on the end of this journey and the begining of something else (something that will stay deeply connected to all of this, which makes it even more beautiful). So, I cried a lot, at the beginning and at the end of the practice, and I played in between. I&#39;ve been practicing with this community for a few years now, but this time, this journey, this night (I&#39;m from France, it&#39;s 10pm right now) was something else. Something precious I will hold on dearly for all the adventures ahead, on and off the mat.

I really enjoyed the 30 days! Do wish there was a voice over for this last day. Found myself not posing well because I had to keep looking to keep up. I look forward to keeping up a daily practice.,Hillcrest Wanderer,2021-01-31T21:05:02Z,23

"I think that the point of day 30 is that you can release yourself from having to follow her, and follow your own intuition to do the moves that feel good. It&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t do the same moves she does, but if you get lost and can&#39;t think of what to do next, you can look up for ideas of what she&#39;s doing.",Bailey Ricketts,2021-02-01T01:37:56Z,15

But I got on the mat, started the video and had one of the most amazing yoga experiences I&#39;ve ever had. I didn&#39;t need another voice to guide me because my breath took over and my body knew exactly what to do. I actually did learn so much more than I realized over this 30 days.

"Practicing with you for two years has been such an honor and privilege .  You and yoga can keep us sane as the world can’t decide what or how to be.  I, personally think that kindness, honor, respect is a good starting place.  Mankind doesn’t have to be so complicated .  We just need to be. I’ve had two bdays since meeting you on the mat so at 69 , I feel that I can get myself in poses with much more ease. Plus, this breathing video cinched it all together.  Still working on balance.  Some days are great, other days I fall. And it’s ok. I love you Ms. Adriene and I will always do yoga with you.  I’ve also become quite the yoga advocate as well.  My heart longs for a lesson with you.  After the pandemic calms down, we’re headed to Austin and if you have a studio , I will find it.",cathy hollaway,2021-01-31T20:54:35Z,0

I&#39;ve always struggled with this perfectionism and I will for a long time. But being on the mat for the past 30 days, I&#39;ve learned bit by bit to accept the way things are, love who I am right now, and to trust myself and the path I have created for myself. The process will take a long time still, but yoga, especially today&#39;s practice, have helped me start to accept the raw and imperfect nature of life, and I plan to continue this journey for a long time.

"It was late at my end, and still I wanted to honour my commitment to this journey by showing up to the mat before bedtime. I had no idea that the class was as long as it was. I had no idea what a treat I was in for either - on so many levels. The beauty of a silent class is, that the teacher gets to dive deeper into their own practice. How precious it is, then, to witness what is possible, and find a potential to grow towards. <br /><br />Thank you for a fundamentally wellness- and health-boosting journey, Adriene - and grandmaster of ceremony, Benji! I breathe deeper, I sleep better, I am getting stronger. If ever there was a &quot;new normal&quot;, I&#39;m doing my best to make a daily yoga practice with you mine.

I didn&#39;t enter this feeling super YEAH LET&#39;S DO IT, I entered calmly, doing one day after another, and now I&#39;ve made it to day 30! I&#39;m super proud of myself and of everyone who did (or is doing) this journey ❤️",Bruna Mandu,2021-01-31T20:48:18Z,76

"thank you. You have helped me over this journey to let go of that which no longer serves me, trust in myself (Which admittedly i have always found hard) and watch my thoughts. In yesterdays practice i shut my eyes and let your voice guide me the entire way through, learning  to trust i was doing it right. And in todays i opened my eyes and breathed. I hope to continue taking each breath as a new beginning, and hope everyone else here can too. Much love x",Zara Fawcett,2021-01-31T20:44:53Z,0

Thank you SO MUCH Adriene! Practicing for 30 days meant so much to me this year. I&#39;ve followed your content for awhile and this was the time that I actually made it through the full 30 day commitment.<br /><br />I have a good &quot;at home yoga studio&quot;  setup and plan to continue practicing.

"Laying in my chosen ending pose of reclined cobbler, I feel so proud that I committed to the 30 Days for once. I will admit I panicked when you said you were taking off your mic, I was like UM PLEASE SAY SIKE. But! I discovered the beauty of listening to my body and finding out what I really needed, finding what feels good. Just to also share my POV a bit, I&#39;m a Christian, and the meaning of beginning with the breath really resonates with me because I believe the breath is the Holy Spirit. I don&#39;t believe in mere coincidences. Thank you for this journey, especially during this difficult time ♡",Kathy Lopez,2021-01-31T20:40:11Z,0

"There&#39;s something very special about hearing all the soundtracks from the previous 30-day journeys, especially that Revolution one... Revolution gets me every time. I started to tear up a little during knocking on heaven&#39;s door, of all things (it&#39;s such a joyful movement!), but at the closing, the tears came fast and furious. Very emotional in the most beautiful way. Having the sun stream through my window and feeling a cool breeze touch my shoulders in savasana, I felt overcome by how precious life is, and how especially important Breath felt after such a wild and difficult year. Thank you so much, Adriene, and the whole YWA community. I hope we all continue to explore our relationship to breath and to ourselves. Namaste. 🙏❤️",Lucie,2021-01-31T20:38:15Z,1

"I didn&#39;t expect to get so emotional today... It is very hard to put into words how much these beautiful daily practices have meant to me, but I&#39;ll try. <br />I&#39;ve always thought of yoga as something very slow, and full of difficult poses. I was astonished with how wrong I was when I started this 30 day journey. What really anchored me to the practice was Adriene&#39;s beautiful, graceful, and mindful presence and soul, and how kindly, and friendly she spoke. I wasn&#39;t sure before I started if I would finish the 30 days, but after I finished day 1, I was sure. I was prepared. I was committed. I was determined. And so, I did every daily practice, and every practice familiarized me even more with yoga, the breath, mindfulness, body-mind-soul connection, and staying mindful and present not only while I was on the mat, but outside of it too. Suddenly, the mat was my safe haven. I felt safe and protected while on my mat, like nothing could touch me, nothing could hurt me. I practiced and practiced every day, and after a few days, it occured to me that yoga had become a habit, and an escape from this crazy reality. I couldn&#39;t even imagine that I wouldn&#39;t show up on the mat every day. And it became non-negotiable. I felt at-peace, powerful, and fragile, calm, and content, and immensely proud for sticking with my practice. <br />When the practice began, I had tears in my eyes, and when it ended as well. I hadn&#39;t realized how connected I felt to Adriene, Benji, and to this beautiful community practicing everyday. So, I very much look forward to seeing you all on the mat tomorrow, and I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart to you, Adriene, and to Benji ❤️❤️❤️ THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️ I will miss seeing a new video every day, but I&#39;m really grateful for the February calendar, which I&#39;ll surely follow!!",Δημήτρης Χ.,2021-01-31T20:36:15Z,2
"I have followed the 30 days and am thankful to have had them.  I looked forward to each practice and am sad that it is over.  For one week my granddaughter was with me every day and nothing like moving from child&#39;s pose to downward facing dog through plank with a 30 pound baby on your back.  SLOWLY!   I&#39;ve been doing yoga now for 10+ years and found new things and challenging moves in this series.  I could do an hour without a guide but would prefer your voice on Day 30 - felt like I had to keep turning my head to see what you were doing.  Other than that, ALL GOOD.  See you in Feb., tomorrow.",martha pitt,2021-01-31T20:35:56Z,1
"Today was the last day of this BREATH journey. I am so so glad that I did it. I didn&#39;t know that I would be able to do it. To learn crow pose and to grow so much on strength and breath.

"Dear Adriene, we are yoga buddies for years. Your random singing sessions and comments always make me laugh. I always say “awh” out loud when you pet Benji.. But this one got me emotional at the beginning, I teared up. Seeing you smile made me happy, it connected me to you. Thank you for being there for me, and for every single person here.

"This was probably my favorite workout ever, with Adriene, who helped me  created it myself.  I&#39;ve done every single series, which have helped build strength in a permanently injured knee (dance/cycling), and when I could finally do yoga squats (toes out), that was a miracle.  But at each of the other 30th (or 31st) days, perhaps I didn&#39;t have enough &quot;vocabulary&quot;, as you say, and though I could create a workout, was not very satisfied with it.  This time, I worked faster, included a couple of binds not seen in the Adriene videos, and worked from top to bottom -- crown to ground.   It was great!  I was hungry and physically tired when I finished!  I think the faster pace made a difference, for me.  I cannot do planks because of 2 different car accidents that did a number on my shoulders, so substitute cat/cow or anything I can think of to build tricep strength.  Just wanted to say this was awesome for me, so kudos, and thanks!",Susan Zoske,2021-01-31T20:18:56Z,1

I definitely prefer Adriene guiding me, but it&#39;s nice to know I have the tools to be able to trust myself. Thank you, Adriene.

I&#39;ve never liked or sticked with any kind of exercise before, but Adriene helped me find I could like it and do it every day.  Amazing!  Thank you Adriene and the kind community.  I only have one minor suggestion.  For Breath daily email, the email title format in the past years was easier to find what day it is.  For example:  &quot;Breath - Day 1 - Invite&quot;.

"First of all thank you so much Adriene and the rest of the team for putting together such an amazing 30 days! I&#39;ve been doing yoga for about the past 4-5 years now and done these 30 day yoga challenges on/off but this is my first time really truly feeling the fruits of my practice and consistency I&#39;ve been putting into my health. I plan to incorporate yoga into my morning workouts as a cool down. I remember the first time I saw one of your videos was a time I was in such a bad anxious stage of my life. You really introduced me to yoga and really how it&#39;s the ultimate act of self-love. I&#39;ll forever be grateful to you for that!! 2020 been such a crazy, rollercoaster of a year and I feel like coming back to practice yoga has been the best choice for my mental and physical health. I enjoyed practicing with all my fellow yogis and hope we can keep these good habits through 2021 :)",Melissa Bhuiyan,2021-01-31T19:46:11Z,0
"It has been the best, most valuable journey! Especially during these times the focus on the breath was so perfect. I feel like I have really learned to appreciate and honour my breath and its enormous power! What an incredible tool to connect with myself, my body and to be present!! Thank you so very much Adriene!",Sarah Schellhas,2021-01-31T19:45:58Z,0
"Thank you Adriene.  I don&#39;t expect you to see this post but I did the full 30 days and I even did the crazy two handed resting my knees on my arms thing (for a second before somersaulting!).  I lost 50 pounds last year and now that my BMI is just under 25 again I wanted to start being active again as I approach 49 years old.  My mom does yoga and I decided to try yours.  I am so happy I did.  I really love the combo of breathing, stretching and strength yoga gives in all in one pose many times.  Your videos were very helpful and you are great at taking it step by step.  I hope I am able to keep this going but funny enough the other day I started doing some yoga routines for 5 minutes on my own.  And I was enjoying it.  I will continue to explore and embrace the new me.  I am a 6&#39;2 male from Chicago.",Ram4,2021-01-31T19:45:33Z,0
"This is my first time commenting and I wanted to share how incredibly moved to tears I was at the end of the practice. From start to now, this has been such a transformational experience for me that I&#39;ve been so grateful to embark on. I think one of my favorite parts was when I felt like knocking on heaven&#39;s door (one of my favorite things to do is say &quot;heeeey girl!&quot; to my own behind, haha! and not a second later, Adrienne followed suit and I did a little dance as if to welcome her into the flow! What an incredibly journey this has been. SO full of love. I can&#39;t wait to see what surprises tomorrow brings &lt;3. Namaste.",Hailey Kay,2021-01-31T19:45:01Z,0

"Wow, often my mind wanders during these practices, something I need to work on but usually I know Adriene is there to remind me what to do (breath for starters). This time I had to focus all by myself and I did it! 50 minutes (40 at least hehe) of peace and just focusing on breathing and moving slowly. Thank you so much for the work you&#39;re doing!",Marie -,2021-01-31T19:44:30Z,0

"Thank you Adriene and Benji for guiding us through the first month of 2021.<br />This is the fifth time I&#39;ve started but the first time I managed to finish the yearly 30 days challenge.. I am feeling accomplished and proud.<br />Today, when I saw the video is 50 minutes long and it is not guided, I really didn&#39;t think I could finish it all by myself. However, time flew by and at the end, I found myself in corpse pose, silently crying and forgiving myself for everything I&#39;ve been blaming myself for.. This is so emotional and so precious to me. Thanks a million to every nice soul who has been on the mat with me. I am beyond grateful for your kindest intentions and good energy that you brought to our sacred connection.

"How is it that the day I was dreading the most turned out to be the most renewing, blissful and life-altering? I guess that’s the magic of yoga in general, and Adriene specifically. I will never stop practicing yoga after how much the discipline of thirty days straight has changed me. The peace and contentment I now feel throughout my days is worth every drop of sweat and falling on my face almost daily. ☺️😂🥰",Erin Johnson,2021-01-31T19:41:18Z,0
"I was so nervous that there wouldn&#39;t be any verbal cues. I think sometimes I trust Adriene more than I trust myself, so if she believed we could do it, I thought I would at least try. And by the end I realised I do utterly trust myself... I guess I just didn&#39;t know it. Sometimes I looked up and I was definitely not where Adriene was, and sometimes I was almost completely in sync. When I closed my eyes, I heard her voice telling me to breathe, to pause, to slow down- she was still guiding me. I loved this practice so much. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be emotional but when Adriene bowed at the very end, I cried. I really needed to learn to trust myself, on the mat and off the mat. Thank you Adriene! Thank you Benji! We love you 💜",Diyaa Kaur,2021-01-31T19:41:02Z,0

During the final shot where you pet Benji and then look straight into the camera, I suddenly realized (and cried) what a precious and generous gift you give. All these thousands of people who learn the beauty of yoga and who are nudged by you into self-love... It is so so powerful. This is the first time I have actually finished the 30 day yoga challenge in January and I could not have done it without my dear friend who lives on the other side of the world.

"Who else cannot believe it is the last day? This is the seventh 30 (or 31) day YWA journey I have taken since finding Adrienne&#39;s channel in 2020 quarantine, but to me it&#39;s the MOST special because it is the first I have been able to share in real time with all of you around the world! Thank you Adrienne and everyone in the FWFG community for your kindness, compassion and camaraderie, something we need more of in the world! Every time I meet you on the mat is a breath of fresh air, and inspiration to my heart!",Michelle N. Collins,2021-01-31T19:19:18Z,0

"this is my 3rd or 4th 30 Days of YWA, and I think this was my favourite series &lt;3 and this is always my favourite practice. during the year, when I&#39;m not following a calendar faithfully, I sometimes think that I am not capable of doing a self-guided practice because I&#39;m not good enough at it, or I can&#39;t remember the poses I know, etc etc. this tradition at the end of every 30 Days always reminds me that I am super capable, and nothing encourages me like catching Adriene&#39;s eye peeking at the camera every so often, or Benji moving in and out of frame. <br />thank you for always doing this for us Adriene, and for the gifts you give us all year long. I feel blessed to have found your channel those many years ago, and I will keep returning. namaste beautiful, kiss Benj for me.",Nikki Goerz,2021-01-31T19:16:19Z,0
"Adriene, I can&#39;t thank you enough. Little did I know how much I needed yoga before I started. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever successfully showed up every day to any 30-day challenge. I practiced in the evening, and each day I looked forward to the peaceful (and challenging!) times on the mat. You&#39;ve helped me believe in myself and what my body is capable of doing, using the power of something that was in me all along - my breath. I feel amazing and I can&#39;t wait to continue this beautifully healing practice. Today is truly a new beginning. &lt;3",raychull88,2021-01-31T19:16:10Z,0
"So. We did it. 30 days of feeling, of conscious breath. I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adriene for a couple of years now but this is the first 30 days I completed and did every single day. We can be so, so proud 😊 it was a pleasure to be in the journey with all of you. Today, all of a sudden, I had this huge smile on my face because I was just embracing it all and it was literally perfect. I teared up a bit of the thought that we think all the time that something in us is wrong and needs to be fixed where in the end, we are all literally perfect from head to toe. It was my utmost pleasure to be together with all of you these 30 days. Have a very good, healthy and happy life on, you all 😊 Namasté ❤",MrsFrappucchino,2021-01-31T19:15:25Z,0

"I didn’t do so well with this today, I started well and felt confident but it unravelled and I ended up a bit lost! I gave up and just sat still and breathed for a while then felt annoyed and couldn’t get going again- think I’ll do this day 30 again tomorrow and get a more positive outcome 💜",moira smith,2021-01-31T19:13:45Z,105
When I got stuck I would peek at Adriene to get some inspiration. It helped. Try it tomorrow just peek at her for inspiration. As long as you are breathing you are doing great,Eveline Pullins,2021-02-01T02:40:53Z,2
"I&#39;m in tears writing this. I saw a 50min video and got so excited for the last but-kicking LONG flowing session! I heard her say &quot;I turn my mic off&quot; and I pressed pause and didn&#39;t even watch anymore of the video. I absolutely hate looking at the screen as it pulls us all away from our practice to have to kink our necks and look at the screen. I just use Adriene&#39;s voice 99% of the time. This did not end the 30 days as I would have liked, getting that push from Adriene to take with us into the next days. I hope she will consider some light guiding in the future. I have let this go, like she says, but its always hard to end  so positive when your momentum comes crashing to a halt at the last day😔",Claudia Evans,2021-02-01T01:25:46Z,5
"I would have loved this final practice so much more if Adriene had given limited guidance. I chose to follow her lead but it was frustrating to have to crank my neck constantly to see when to come out of some poses. Still, I&#39;m grateful for the journey and hope to continue.",Frances Friend,2021-02-01T00:55:43Z,6

"There will always be another day 30 💕 I actually scanned some of the poses earlier / before practice so that I knew the general flow, but it’s is hard to do it yourself. Wishing you luck in the next time you do it!",Manali Shinde,2021-02-01T00:06:16Z,3
"Oh my god, I did it?! I actually managed to stick with it, achieve it. I did this for me, for myself. And I managed to push back at life every time it wanted to steal my me-time. After 18 years of having a go at trying to do yoga now and then, I now feel so different after 30 days uninterrupted practice. <br />I hope I can say “oh my god I did it” again at the end of February, because this feels good. For me. And a me that feels good and happy, is a me that can achieve more outwards, for other people. <br />Thanks you xxx",Ingrid Wimart,2021-01-31T19:13:43Z,0

"10 minutes in I got a migraine, heart burn, and my vestibular balance disorder started acting up all at once. Plus a panic attack because I started overthinking everything and didn&#39;t know what to do. Yay. I guess it&#39;s only proper for my last day to feel like my first. Break down city. Oh well. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m ready to do an hour of yoga all on my own without instruction, even without physical ailments rearing their heads.

"We have come a long way. In fact: I have come a long way. The last year has been troublesome. In January, I woke up with vertigo. It took a few days for it to disappear. In the middle of the year, the vertigo came back with a bad headache. Apparently, everything is fine. But the psychological side effects of the vertigo were exhausting: until now, I can&#39;t lay down with my head on the floor. With yoga, I&#39;m learning to trust my body again. Thank you, Adriene, for taking me there at my own pace.",Caro,2021-01-31T19:12:04Z,0

I can&#39;t remember which year that&#39;s from but it must be very meaningful deep inside me. When I started practicing with YWA, it sparked much needed self love in my life and growth, healing, self discovery... I&#39;m forever grateful Adriene, and YWA team!!!

"So bittersweet because I grabbed this practice as a lifesaver during a very unstable turbulent time. I&#39;m sure I am not alone in this.

"Wow, this practice did not go as I expected. I was a bit anxious and sure that I would get lost without your voice, Adriene, to guide my practice. But somehow, I did the first about 20 minutes all on my own, without glancing at the screen much (except admiring your graceful moves from time to time), and moved as my body told me to. Then, I took some inspiration from your positions and flows and made it my own. This gave me new confidence in my body and showed me what you meant by trusting ourselves... Thank you, Adriene! I got a bit emotional too at the end - but I will see you on the mat again soon! Much love from Europe &lt;3",Tee Tasse,2021-01-31T19:09:36Z,0

"Adriene, this was the first Day 30 in all the years I&#39;ve been attempting this challenge that I wasn&#39;t intimidated of following my own intuition. I did standing splits, chair pose, and crow all of my own volition without feeling lazy or afraid of falling. Your inspiration in this practice helped keep me on track and I trusted myself to breathe and move in a way that felt right for my body. And now, I&#39;m dripping in sweat and also so relaxed and at peace. Thank you for this journey for my body and my mind. I feel more myself than ever right now. Thank you to all and namaste!

I am proud that I stuck with it, that I did all 30 days, that through some parts I was able to be me and that I was listening to my breath.  And at the end, I always seem to shed a few tears.

Today was very emotional not only because it was the last day but because it truly just felt magical. I have a bad past from abuse and tried to end my breath at one stage and here I am today encouraging it. I allowed myself to cry during my yoga practice because I can. I am grateful for my breath and I will continue to use it off the mate. I sincerely thank you Adriene for everything that she has helped me with from my highs to my lows and I will begin my breath everyday. Thank you Adriene from us all. Xxxxx ❤️❤️❤️❤️,Bangtan Boys,2021-01-31T18:59:55Z,0

"It is so incredible what your work does! I was a total mess at day one, physically and mentally, since July I was stuck in an almost permanent anxiety status, but since the first day of the 30 days practice progressed I felt such a relive in my mind and body for the first time in my life! It is the first time I feel in charge of my own body, my own life and my own mind! The anxiety is not totally gone, but so much more manageable then before! I can’t thank you Adrienne enough for this beautiful gift you share with us all! You are really an angel! And it was so interesting for me that all the postures today I could do almost effortlessly, which I could not always do in the last 29 days. It is impressive what you can accomplish in just 30 days! I definitely want to continue practicing every day! I see you on the mat Adrienne tomorrow with heartfelt greetings from the bottom of my heart from little Vienna!",NoraErdbeer,2021-01-31T18:59:17Z,1
"I started crying half way through this  practice. I just started to feel so emotional and thankful for this experience.

When I first started this 30 day journey I could not bend my right leg all the way when I tried to do child&#39;s pose. But everyday I kept trying and now on this last day my right knee is so much better. I feel a little discomfort but I could breath myself into a nice relaxed child&#39;s pose. My hip on that same side is much much better too! Thank you with all my heart! My husband says he will join my on my next 30 day yoga challenge with you. So grateful for you Miss Adriene!,Bernardette Kasum,2021-01-31T18:56:37Z,0

"I&#39;m not crying, you&#39;re crying! But seriously, thank you so much Adriene (and Benji!). This is the second year I followed through all 30 days and I am so grateful. No matter how many weeks throughout the year I sometimes go without stepping on the mat, for 5 years now your 30 day yoga journeys have made me come back to it (although the first couple of years I didn&#39;t do it in 30 days). Also, it is amazing how this journey always shifts my mindset. One time during this wonderful last session I came out of a twist and saw Adriene flying in crow pose and instead of talking negatively about myself in my head because I can&#39;t do crow at the moment, I instantly felt so proud and happy for Adriene that she can do it so nicely. This is what yoga and this community does! Much love &lt;3",Annika Namyslo,2021-01-31T18:52:37Z,0
"STANDING OVATION!!! When I wasn&#39;t swept away in the beautiful depths of my own body&#39;s knowledge of itself and its needs-- and I got the rare glance of Adriene during her practice I truly saw that this is an angel on Earth. The grace of your movements and the kindness that held your face up in rapture--absolutely otherworldly. Dear beautiful Adriene, thank you for bringing your angelic presence to this space and to my heart. Namaste.",justcausethatswhy,2021-01-31T18:52:00Z,0

I thought I would complete this practice bright and early today but circumstances didn&#39;t allow. I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t work out because I got to practice with the breeze at my balcony today and when practice was ending and I saw Adriene smile I cried a bit coz I was so overwhelmed and sad this is over. Even though I intend to keep going this journey was so incredible and it felt so good to be connected to other people in this way. I feel blessed and grateful. I came back now a couple of hours later just to watch Adriene again and to express my gratitude for these past 30 days. Namaste,Senthuri Pillai,2021-01-31T18:51:15Z,0
"This is the most I&#39;ve sweat with any YWA video, and I feel so accomplished and proud. I am devoted to a more regular yoga practice for the rest of this year and beyond.

"I feel so lucky that Day 30 falls on this day each year because it is my birthday! This is my fourth year starting the year with the 30 Day Journey, since True in 2018, and Day 30 gets more magical with every time. I&#39;m turning 24 today, and it&#39;s like I&#39;m starting my calendar year with the beginning and the next year of my life with the end. I get emotional every time the musical motifs from the prior years come in because it reminds me of that time in my life, and I realized today that I am really happy with where I&#39;ve come and where I am since then. It&#39;s really overwhelming. Since starting with the channel in summer 2017, this has been an amazing ride. Thank you for the birthday present.",Kate Finnerty,2021-01-31T18:46:50Z,0

But I&#39;m so proud of myself for pulling through.<br /><br />Fun fact: I only started this program because I have issues with my skin and sweating actually hurts a lot, so I was looking for a way of moving my body, building strength and flexibility without sweating and I have to say, I was not disappointed!

"Thank you, Adriene and team for creating this oportunity for all of us! It was amazing! I panicked a little when i realized i&#39;m on my own but took a deep breath and decided to give it a go. I freestyled the entire 50min and only peeked sometimes for ideas about what to do next. I think there were a few mooments where i was just standing there watching Adriene flow and thinking wow she&#39;s so graceful... then i went back to being an awkward wobbly duck and enjoying it. Sometimes i felt the flow and other times i felt distracted, out of synch and weird.

But now I feel like it&#39;s the time to thank you so much for this journey. <br />I love the way in which you created these 30days, the practice felt so natural and there was so much integrity in the way you put together the pranayama, the asanas and the constant reminders to fwfg. <br />I spend most of the time alone in quarantine for I had caught corona and this journey definitely helped me to accept my emotional roller coaster and even enjoy it. <br />Also I never felt able to put together such a long sequence by myself and always avoided it or gave up after 10 or 15min. This time it was suddenly so easy to practice next to you.

At first I was intimidated by the intimacy of a practice without verbal guidance, but eventually it felt so peaceful to me. I enjoyed my experience, my whole 30 day experience, and I never thought I would make it this far.

I created a whole 50 minute practice all by myself. I can&#39;t believe how much I have learnt over the past 30 days. Thank you, Adriene  ♥️",Billie Hart,2021-01-31T18:37:54Z,0
"I learned way more than I thought I’d learn from this practice. Not only in terms of exercises, yoga positions but also in terms of identity, myself. I feel like this experience really helped me find out what calmness is and how important my breath is. It’s not only a tool meant to help us live but also a way to bring peace into our lives. Thank you for all of this. Namaste 🙏",L,2021-01-31T18:37:50Z,3
"I did it!!! I am feeling calmer, happier and stronger. I believe in myself and I know I can do daily yoga for another 30 days. Thank you Adriene for guiding me. My only goal was to show up to my mat every day for 30 days. I did as much as I could and surprised myself by being able to do more than I thought I could. I am breathing deeply and calmly with a smile in my face as I write this. That is the effect this daily practice has on me every day, and for that I am truly grateful. 💕",Angela Anderson,2021-01-31T18:37:47Z,0

"This was so beautiful. I just have to give serious snaps for your music over the years Adriene, it felt like seeing old friends :&#39;) the Home and Revolution journeys in particular were so potent for me when I did them, so you better believe when those tunes kicked in I cried sweet tears whilst taking up all the space! Gorgeous music bridging myself and my yoga practice across past and present. <br />Thank you and well done EVERYONE. I imagined us all doing our own yoga dances across this beautiful planet. We are very much the same but also miraculously different. I followed and trusted my breath all the way through and it gives me joy to think that others were following their own unique song too. So much love x",Elizabeth Harper,2021-01-31T18:37:21Z,0
"I&#39;ve always followed along on these as best I could because I crave structure.  This is the first journey I&#39;ve done where I&#39;ve truly just let go, breathed, and moved the way my body wanted to. There was a few panicky moments where I was like OH NO have I run out of things to do? I would peek at Adriene and say &quot;oh right there&#39;s that&quot; and find a way to get there. Like a friendly clue &amp; a nudge to find my own rhythm. I feel so much more accomplished - I was floored I did the whole 50 minutes. I feel strong, focused, and clear. Thank you Adriene &amp; sleepy Benji. Can&#39;t wait to continue.",Amanda Fulmer,2021-01-31T18:36:51Z,0
"Adriene thank you so so so much for this practice! When I have done your other 30 days of yoga, I must admit I often skip a day and I always skip the last day because I don’t think I could guide myself through a practice. But this month was my first time signing up and getting the emails which kept me so motivated and I didn’t miss one day! There weren’t even days where I didn’t feel like doing it. I have been working from my kitchen/sitting room this past year so it’s hard to switch off but doing these videos after work has helped so much. I am amazed at myself and that I could do this practice today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this experience ❤️ well done to everyone else in this community too! 😊",Zara Walsh,2021-01-31T18:36:33Z,0

Recommendations for beginner books? Anyone? I loved the past 30 days. My FIRST time!  I DID IT! No I could not do every single thing but when I could not do a move yet I did what I could and kept going. Don’t give up.

Day 30. I struggled to keep up with you today but realised that as long as I was doing some movement and breathing it didn&#39;t much matter. However I caught sight of myself in the mirror this morning in an impromptu dancer&#39;s pose and had to laugh! Thanks Adriene for a great journey. Tried to sign up to begin again tomorrow but so far no joy with a confirmation email? Perhaps you are overwhelmed.,Joanna Wilkinson,2021-01-31T18:35:29Z,0

I didn&#39;t know I had so many resources until now and it has been thanks to your amazing guiding during this month. Now I am emotional and crying.

I always try to follow the video and wish there were some kind of prompts to keep me from looking at the screen. Eventually I find a rhythm but still find myself looking at the video. I made it though. Congrats to all on a successful journey. I hope you all continue to find success on and off the mat. Now, on to the next adventure!",Jeffrey Collins,2021-01-31T18:33:58Z,0
"Thank you, Adriene! I remember last year, my first time doing the 30-day journey, when you said that we would be practicing on our own for the last day how I panicked immediately. That practice ended in a completely different mindset, one where I felt proud, confident, and calm. This year, knowing it was coming, I was actually excited to listen to my body for this last day. This was the first time I&#39;ve done a 30-day journey live, and I got emotional during this last practice knowing that I and so many others stuck with this for so long. Congratulations everyone for choosing to take time for you, and I hope we all continue regular practice past this 30-day journey. What a wonderful one it&#39;s been &lt;3",Erin Noelle,2021-01-31T18:33:21Z,0

My mind stayed in tune to my positions and what felt right. When it got a little hard I heard &quot;breath&quot; and then suddenly strength appeared. Beautiful 30 days Adrienne. You and Benji have taught me how to save myself. Thank you from the deepest depths of my heart.  I&#39;ll see you on the mat tomorrow. With love... Namaste",Cathy Welch,2021-01-31T18:31:36Z,0

"I almost skipped today, thought about putting on a different practice, because I didn’t want to do it without Adriene’s guidance. But then, I realized, this is what it’s all about—deciding to take a risk, to breathe deeply, to listen trustingly to the voice within. I did what Adriene said: start with the breath, and then just do what feels good, what the body craves. I went very slowly, listening to the beautiful music, breathing the scent of my candle, learning step by step to trust myself, and whenever I got stuck I watched a bit of the video and there was my good friend Adriene reminding me of all she’s taught me. I took the video back at the end so we could bow together. I finished with a sense of confidence and hope I had been seeking from others, but now know it resides within, just like Adriene says. Thank you so much Adriene, Benji, the team, and the community for this ongoing gift. Namaste 🙏🏽❤️",Lorinda Toledo,2021-01-31T18:31:18Z,0

"Thank you so much Adriene and to this amazing, supportive community!  I am so proud of all of you (and myself!!) for making it to day 30.  As with past day 30s, I sort of panicked at the beginning, especially after I saw the length of the practice.  But then I started and kept on, listening to my body.  I have a shoulder injury that I&#39;m working to heal from a wreck, so I did those exercises and doing them to the music helped me keep a regular rhythm and, as I looked up at Adriene, I could almost hear her saying, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you for doing what you need to do for your body.  Your practice isn&#39;t about me, it&#39;s about you.&quot;  I am planning to continue my daily practice with the monthly calendars, and I added a Bridge pose towards the end (cheated and looked ahead).

I go forth giving myself grace and the knowledge that my body will move as it wants at the moment and our practice is our practice, no matter how it might look to others-Namaste",Marte Glebe,2021-01-31T18:20:15Z,0

Thank you so much for all the hard work that you and your team put into all your videos. I have loved showing up every day and the practice has really helped me stay on an even keel this month.

"Well, I&#39;m having accomplishment tears haha. It sounds silly, but I&#39;ve tried this challenge two years running and somehow I always fell off track, missed a bunch of days, and just went on with life. I can&#39;t believe I finally finished a 30 Days of Yoga my third year trying. And amazingly (unsurprisingly?) I&#39;ve felt real, tangible change in my body, flexibility, and yes how I breathe. I&#39;m so excited for more and so glad I got to do it alongside y&#39;all! Thank you!",MeghanKel,2021-01-31T18:12:57Z,0

I felt so accomplished and confident. I&#39;ve been practicing for a while, but after this challenge, I think I want to start my yoga teacher training!!

"I want to say a big thank you to you Adrienne for this wonderful 30 day practice. There were days where I did not think I would be able to get through the session, a day where all I could do was sit and calm my mind from the stress and fatigue that I was under, and days where I felt true connection to myself, the world and some sense of calm and stillness. Today, of all days, was one of the most serene practices even though self-guided practice is extremely intimidating for me. Thank you truly.<br /><br />Thank you to this beautiful community. Reading the positive comments and thoughts of encouragement has been so heart warming. <br /><br />May all of you find as many moments of joy that this life offers.

"I was touched by her words at the beginning and didn’t know how I’d feel through the video. I was delaying playing it.    <br />Now after completing it, I can say that I smiled through most of the time. I missed her voice very much, her jokes, her laughs, it all. I kept thinking what jokes should would make at different moments...  And strangely (maybe), but I could hear her voice, as if she WAS guiding me. She taught me so many things, and now, at the top of my mat, I can’t reach up without a smile and without “catching a star” to bring it down to my heart or to “put it in my pocket” to save it for later...<br />Thank you sooo much, Adriane!

"I was reading the comments (as I always do) and felt a bit of a cheater.<br /><br />From time to time I tried to find my own flow, but I think because I lack self confidence and I always double check what I do, I had to peak at Adriene most of the time - therefore the cheating feeling came in strong.<br /><br />But I made it. <br />It&#39;s been exactly 1 year since last time I did 30 days yoga journey and this time I want to continue day after day until I can say &quot;It&#39;s been 2  months of uninterrupted yoga&quot;, then 3, 4 and finally 1 year.<br />Hopping after 1 year I will be able to find myself.<br /><br />Thank you Adriene and thank you all who accompanied me on this lovely journey!",Reya 13,2021-01-31T17:56:51Z,1

"&quot;breath&quot; the first yoga journey that i followed in real time and, i gotta be honest, i cried at the end of this video. i&#39;ve been doing yoga since march 2020 and at the beginning i didn&#39;t think i could stick to it but here i am, doing yoga everyday since the start of italy&#39;s CO-VID19 lockdown. i now feel part of this kind community and i owe it all you you, adriene. thank you so much",??,2021-01-31T17:55:50Z,32

"Me: what do you mean you are turning off your mic!? Panic ensues. *note- panic and old age don’t mix well...<br /><br />Got through it and it was beautiful but, I have to ask .. did anyone else lose their balance or place while trying to peek!? What I learned today is I mostly listen.. i have truly developed that skill..I look up infrequently and then just to make sure I heard right. This would be why I struggled w in person yoga classes.  No cues just flow.  <br /><br />With all that said I found today an emotional journey; sadness that it’s ending; gladness that I did get through it; joy in almost doing dancers pose; but most of all gratefulness for the gift of Breath. If I have learned anything this year is not to take it for granted.  <br /><br />I will miss this daily “surprise” of new practices. But, will take a deep breath and figure out where my yoga journey goes next. <br /><br />🙏🏻❤️ to you all and of course Adriene and Benji for an amazing start to this year.  <br /><br />Namaste 🧘",Dee Dee Lynch Silverstein,2021-01-31T17:55:41Z,1
"As I bowed my head in Namaste at the end of my practice alongside you and the FWFG community around the world, tears begin streaming down my face. I am not sad simply grateful for the breath, for my body and this practice, for the trust you restored within me with myself, with the connection between my body, mind and soul and how honoured I am to have learned the vocabulary to create my very own practice according to what came up for me. I kept trying to show myself compassion for not being perfect and reminding myself that there is no wrong answer. Reminding myself to return to the breath when I felt lost and to focus on what feels good and to not let that end. From the very bottom of my heart and the depths of my soul, thank you Adrienne for creating this 30 day journey. I am so grateful that you opened the door for my own practice. Thank you to all the FWFG community for joining me in today’s courageous practice. Namaste. &lt;3",Jenni Lee,2021-01-31T17:55:40Z,0

I was trying to follow along but without the verbal cues, I felt like I was straining my neck every two seconds or coming out of the pose to check if we were moving on.  :(  I guess I know now that I like the verbal queues a lot.

"@Edith Linnéa you don&#39;t find that frustrating? I like flows, and I like knowing I work each side evenly, so these are really awful for me and I have to keep looking at the screen.

"@Prosateuse I’ve only done yoga for about two years on and off so videos is my go to. But doing day 30 is a part of the Breath series and a challenge. It’s hard but we’ve done som many poses these past days so the next one is which ever comes next to mind. You can do it! If you get lost, just remember to breathe. But if It’s not your cup of tea at all to try then maybe redo another video?",Edith Linnéa,2021-02-01T06:25:28Z,0
"@Bees movies I hope that every year and I&#39;m always disappointed 😂 it&#39;s such an anticlimactic way to end the series, not being able to do it because you have to keep looking at the screen like it&#39;s your first ever yoga video.",Prosateuse,2021-01-31T23:08:29Z,0

"Wow! Day 30!<br />I love the fact that this practice is called &quot;begin&quot;. It&#39;s the cyclicality that governs the universe. Like the breath. After an exhale, comes an inhale. And after that inhale comes a new exhale and so on. <br />It&#39;s beautiful that we get to choose our own practice today. It means that we&#39;ve got the necessary tools to be in control and to guide our bodies to &quot;find what feels good&quot;. The first times I was practicing yoga with Adriene I couldn&#39;t let go of the video on day 30, but after some time I found the confidence and courage to explore and listen to myself. This feels great!<br />So if you&#39;re having a hard time letting yourself go today, don&#39;t worry! Trust yourself, you&#39;ve got it! You know what you need and more importantly: there&#39;s no right or wrong. Just let each movement unfold and enjoy the process.<br />Love you guys! Thank you for this wonderful experience. Adriene, you&#39;re an angel! ❤️",Bea,2021-01-31T17:52:40Z,0
"This was the first time on Day 30 I was able to let go a little more and just say &quot;ok Adriene, I&#39;ll see what my body is asking for and see you at the end&quot;. Can&#39;t say I was able to do that for the entire time (I&#39;d peek for cues sometimes) but when I did it was really cool. I&#39;m usually more emotional on Day 30 than I was today -- until Adriene wiped away tears during savasana. Then I cracked.

Guess my inner sequence was linked up to hers for a moment. And of course thank you for another beautiful January. I shed a few tears again this year, but less than last. Seems I&#39;ve gotten stronger after a horrible (and wonderful) year of moving  country (again), leaving my friends behind, starting over, going to a school and having to study in a language that isn&#39;t my first (or second...

I was even a bit surprised by how emotional it was for me (as it was my first 30 day yoga journey).

"Thanks Adrienne and Benjie. Followed you for these 30 days, inspirational. I could ‘hear you’ in day 30, telling us to slap our booty, half way lift your version and we have a lot of tools to use. You’ve given me so much confidence, built my strength mentally and physically and given me the trust to continue. I will miss you but look forward to following the February timetable. I’m telling all my friends to join you, good luck. Angelique from the UK. Xx",Emily Matthews,2021-01-31T17:36:55Z,2

"Thank you! This also marks 2 months for me doing daily yoga (I did the Home series in December) and I really can tell a difference in my body from that regular practice! I&#39;m more flexible, I feel stronger and I keep getting comments if I lost weight (a couple lbs, but I think it&#39;s more of a fat-&gt;muscle conversion and leaner muscles because of yoga.) I&#39;m sad because this particular part of the journey is over, but I&#39;m really looking forward to continuing on with this. I keep reading about how people&#39;s bodies are paying the price during lockdown with non-ergonomic desk setups, staying inside, not going to the gym and I feel so lucky to have YWA to help with all those things and more.",Melissa F,2021-01-31T17:35:15Z,0

"Oh Adriene. I don&#39;t know where to start.<br />Came to practice today with a sense of hesitation. I never did Day 30 on your Yoga Journey before - because I thought what I loved most about Yoga was to be guided and &quot;switching off&quot; my brain for the practice, just being told what to do next. The idea of you not talking, but just practicing just didn&#39;t make sense to me - I mean, what was I supposed to do then?<br />Still, I pressed play - and oh how much JOY I have found in this hour. Most of the time I practiced along with you - but now and then, I really felt like doing something entirely different, and without much thinking, I did it. I have found so much joy in this practice because I felt you enjoyed your practice too, to me it seemed that not talking for a change kind of &quot;freed&quot; you to just play, move, breathe and practice as well, without concentrating on what to say next.<br />I really admired how this Day 30 practice was crafted as well - I feel like every single pose we did during the whole 30 day journey was in this, every one was like a friendly reminder like, hey, remember that day? Yeah, we did that pose too! You can do it!<br />I did every video of this series, the day it came out. First time for me of not only starting,  but actually also finishing a 30 day journey with you. I am deeply grateful, I feel inspired, and was deeply moved by these 30 days as well. Love to you Adriene, love to everyone practicing, filled with joy, gratefulness, love. All the feels. &lt;3",Lisa Laquelle,2021-01-31T17:32:16Z,1

"I definitely got nervous when I had to practice without guidance, but I managed to just move...with my breath and my mind?

"Dear Adriene, a (very public) love letter from me to you this time. Thank you for an incredible 30 days. I spent most of the beginning of the practice in tears (happy ones) but moved from that to a feeling of euphoria as I worked through the practice with you. I surprised and delighted myself by remembering so much more than I&#39;d realised but could also hear you, like little Angel Adriene, talking to me from within  - from tapping into my inner smile to smearing honey during the twist, from enjoying my little love cave during child&#39;s poise to  slapping my butt during Knocking On Heaven&#39;s Door! I channeled my breath using it in the way you&#39;ve taught me, I thought about the juxtaposition of internal and external rotations....I could go on. It was an incredible hour made all the more special by seeing that I&#39;d been practicing with almost 11,000 folk. That&#39;s a lot of people taking what they&#39;ve learned on the mat into the world and that can only be a good thing. Namaste. Here&#39;s to the next adventure.

"I really enjoyed following my intuition on this one. It was fun to occasionally look at the screen and be reminded of poses I could incorporate into my next flow. The last time I completed a 30 day journey with Adriene I found my self doing very similar poses to her as I followed along on day 30. Today I was completely off doing my own thing listening to what my body needed, knowing Adriene was there if I needed some inspiration. I didn’t get emotional, but man, those pigeons at the beginning and end of my practice sure did feel good.",Brittny Bevel,2021-01-31T17:24:02Z,0

"This was my third 30 Day Journey with Adriene so I knew what was coming and it scared me.  I love listening to Adriene&#39;s voice and I usually do most of the practices with my eyes closed. I like structure and so to have none freaks me out.  But this time, I told myself to just breathe and see where the Breath takes you.  I had some achy body parts, so I knew some areas that needed attention and there was a balancing pose I wanted to give one more try.  So I just started in a comfortable seat with the breath and it took me on the journey I needed for today.  I did experience that one amazing moment where I looked at my screen and I was in the exact same posture as Adriene and I smiled.  Thank you Adriene and Benji for being our amazing guides.

"Adriene I could cry right now. You have no idea how much this has loved, supported and kept me going over the past month. Yes, I am stronger and safer in my body, calmer and certainly bendier, but more than that - in a time where we’re all isolated - it has really picked me up having you here as a friend. Even little things like your affectionate emails, or hearing you breaking into a song or a joke in the video, have been enough to change my day around sometimes. Thank you, here’s to February x",Freya,2021-01-31T17:11:36Z,0

"Since this was my first 30 day challenge, I had no idea what to expect coming into this practice and what a roller coaster it was. When I saw today&#39;s session I first thought to skip it. I didn&#39;t trust that I could &#39;wing it&#39; for the duration and feel in control of the experience. I gave it a go and after 20 minutes of flow I hit a wall.<br /><br />I got up from the mat, and tried to tell myself halfway was good enough. Reading all the comments here inspired me to begin again, starting from seated with some affirmations and finish strong.

"I cried at the end... I heard the title song and I just cried, of joy.  I&#39;m coming from so far. I started doing yoga (with Adriene) 2 years ago, in a middle of a depression. It was hard, I wasn&#39;t always motivated, these were times I struggled. I&#39;ve learned a lot about myself back then (still am). And now, here I am, two years later, loving yoga and meditation, feeling flexible, stronger (physically and mentally), feeling whole. And, did the whole 30 day yoga journey without missing a day (the first time that it ever happens!). In these tough and strange times we are all living now, it is really a relief. A light even. Thank you so much &lt;3",chacha_,2021-01-31T17:08:24Z,0

Feels great to just vibe and move alongside the video while doing your own thing. Last year it took me a month and a half to complete the series. This year I’m really proud to say I’ve done the video each day! And it just felt right, I didn’t have to force it. Thank you so much Adrienne, Benji, and the YWA team. This series felt especially needed and I really appreciated the theme of breath. See you guys on the collective yoga mat of the earth... much love! Keep breathing!",Gina Lerman,2021-01-31T17:06:23Z,0

Marcel Marceau yoga - great moves in the last 30 days. Not to be contrary but I go to Ludwig Van #6 - the Pastoral symphony instead of new age tunes. He was deaf when he wrote this and composed it in his mind as he walked through the woods - so Yoga in silence is impossible because my mind hears Ludwig. Great month here &amp; I did it with millions of others all around this dust spot we call the earth.,Roger Clem,2021-01-31T17:05:22Z,0

"Who else quit after a few minutes or so? I’m sorry I loved this series but this missed the mark for me and caused so much frustration: if I wanted to listen to elevator music for 50 minutes and do random yoga moves I can do that on my own, I’m here for instruction and guidance. Sucks to be vision impaired for this one I guess, no audio clues at all and you’re on your own. I could not get into it at all and constantly interrupted every pose to see if we were still supposed be on x pose or if we had moved to y pose.

Thank you , Adriene and Benji, for guiding us, and thank you to the whole community for making this so special. I am so proud of us!<br /><br />Adriene, you truly touched my soul, and you truly changed my life - in general, but through this journey in particular. All my love goes out to you.<br /><br />With every breath, a new arrival. And with every ending, a new beginning. <br /><br />Namaste, my friends.❤️",E. P.,2021-01-31T16:59:42Z,0
"So, so beautiful.  Music has always impacted me and the opening music was no exception.  I literally cried through the first 11 minutes of practice.  I had just come to my meditation room after hearing a bit of news...vaccines, disagreement, one year since covid (etc, etc) and I think it all just hit me!  One year since the day that would change all of our lives dramatically.  But the breath is what connects us to this moment and allows us to surrender, allow, trust and open to it so that we can begin anew in each moment.  I do not know what the future holds for any of us but the vision I saw during savasana spoke the truth.  I saw the light of God/the Universe/the Creator streaming down upon all of us lighting our way with love.  Wishing light and love in each of your lives.<br />Thank you Adriene.",Susan Long,2021-01-31T16:59:28Z,0

This was the second one I followed, and the last day worked out so much easier this time. I freestyled my way through it, somehow mostly exactly knowing what to do next, without really thinking about it. I only had two short moments of hesitation. I finished my freestyle one minute before the end of the video and had to laugh about this. <br />Thanks Adriene, for trusting and believing in us, that we find our way through this practice even without your voice.",trailer toe,2021-01-31T16:59:25Z,0

Goose bumps. Very end of practice.  I have been doing theses 30 days as long as I can remember. The silent practice is always my hardest to connect and feel it. This one was different. Breath.

I just LOVE that day thirty fell on a sunday this year, weekdays are always so busy for me i don&#39;t feel like i have the time to really melt into my practice sometimes, so being able to take all the time i want on a sunday morning was lovely.<br /><br />I always love day 30, mostly doing my own thing but still glancing up now and again to see what you&#39;re up to and taking cues sometimes on what would be nice to do next. thank you so much for what you do, and thank you to everyone who went on this journey together!",Sam Warren,2021-01-31T16:52:16Z,0

"Feeling so much gratitude to you Adriene, and for this shared space of community practicing together. I feel restored. And this last practice...I&#39;ve been doing the 30 day challenges for a few years; this was the first time I started out on my own and felt my way through. It&#39;s freezing here, but I was hit by a big sunbeam. And several times when I did peek at you, we were doing the same thing at the same time. And then other times I&#39;d come back and accept what you were doing as a gentle challenge/suggestion, join in, and then branch off again and keep finding my own way. It felt like a metaphor for a well balanced life. ❤️❤️❤️",Kirsten Reed,2021-01-31T16:49:31Z,0

"I was studying dance in college, and since the pandemic began last year, I fell through with all of my strong habits- going to the gym daily, choreographing things and finding dance in my every day, connecting with other bodies and other people. Today was the first time in a very long time that I pushed myself into a kind of dance again, without shame or guilt or embarrassment, I felt infinite space to reside in, spread across the four corners of my mat. I didn&#39;t expect todays practice to be like this, but damn, I am so thankful I found a piece of myself again. Thank you Adriene, and Benji. Your smiles throughout this dance gave me gentle hand squeezes along the way.",whitney nicole,2021-01-31T16:39:38Z,0

"I’ve loved this whole journey until today. I’m so sorry to be negative, but I had a really hard time with no verbal cues. I had to watch the screen the whole time, never got into my breath, was unsure which leg I had already lunged with. I actually quit it at minute 17 I was so frustrated. Am I alone in this feeling? It’s the first and only thing that I’ve found disappointing in this journey. 😢",Kate,2021-01-31T16:37:56Z,0

Thank you. 🙏🏻",Kate,2021-01-31T17:25:22Z,1
"I believe it takes a hell of a lot of courage to make it to the 17 minute mark of this practice. We have been held, so consistently and for so long, by Adriene and her sweet voice. It is totally human of us to have mental stops and hiccups. Throughout today&#39;s practice, I definitely had a couple of mental pauses, &#39;wait, how&#39;d I get into that lunge? oh, I guess I&#39;m not sure&#39;, but eventually, I found that lunge on the other side again. Our journey won&#39;t be perfect, with an equal amount of time spent on &quot;both sides&quot; of the body, or even a perfect replica of what we did the first time. This is how we learn about ourselves, and discover our own inner teacher. The initiation to Find What Feels Good could absolutely be you substituting another video in lieu of today&#39;s practice. So find what feels good, Kate, I think you&#39;ve done an insurmountably incredible job of taking on this journey and being here today. It&#39;s in our goofs and the things that challenge us where we really discover how to persevere, and how to breathe.<br />You should come back to day 30 in your own beautiful, sweet way, with perhaps another ywa video to wrap things up with a big bow. You&#39;re not alone, we&#39;ll all be breathing with you :-)",whitney nicole,2021-01-31T16:49:54Z,0

"I never comment on videos, but I felt I just couldn’t leave without contributing something to the sea of support under this lovely day 30 practice. Adriene, I can’t thank you enough. Your positive attitude and energy every day has been so rewarding, especially when I feel like I’m dragging myself into a practice. I did Home in August and learned so much, showed up every day, and vastly improved my vocabulary. However, on day 30, I saw that the practice was unguided, and didn’t trust myself enough to try it out. This time, guided by my breath, I decided to give it a try. And guess what? When the music ended, I had just put my hands together and was just about to say namaste. I was so shocked that the fifty minutes were over! YouTube autoplayed another video and I actually said “wait what? But I didn’t even get to say goodbye!!” out loud to my phone. Then I realized that that’s just what this practice is all about. It’s a new beginning. Don’t decide where it ends. I had so much fun exploring my practice today, and I just trusted myself to explore and be creative. The result? I held crow for longer than I have ever before! Adriene and this community’s inspiring comments I would read in preparation for or after most practices have been so fun to practice with, but I can guarantee that this is just the beginning! Thank you, everyone. Let’s all continue to show up. Let’s all continue to listen to our breath.The journey is only beginning.  Namaste.",Studio Emi,2021-01-31T16:36:38Z,0

Oh em gee. So I didn’t make it through the whole thing. I gassed out and got to 31 minutes. Like a bit of perspiration 😁- exciting. Then joined in again and completed about a couple of more minutes.

"Thank you ever so much, Adriene, for this gift of  BREATH to the world. And I am proud. I have done it😊. Today was one of my best practices.

Namaste to everyone who was on that journey at the same time😊",Silke Ma,2021-01-31T16:35:03Z,1

Love love love these long flows to music at the end of each 30 day program. I do wish there was something to alert us to the change in pose (a soft bell perhaps?) so we can keep the flow going without having to constantly peek at the video. Just a suggestion.

"When I started this journey I couldn’t touch my toes. I couldn’t do a proper chataranga. I used to practice many years ago but usually only once a week - it turns out having any food in my stomach while practicing makes me nauseated for hours, and I never took the time in the morning. I’m taking it now, and yoga will be a daily practice from now on.",Sarah T,2021-01-31T16:27:38Z,18

"Although I did miss Adriene´s voice to guide me a bit, what I really liked about today is that I could clearly see the benefits of the 30 days journey compared to doing yoga 3/4 days a week: forward  falls are paradise,  I did the side planks without thinking about it, etc.... So after a couple of years doing a couple of free yoga sessions a week, I am now ready for daily practice supporting Find What Feels Good 😌 💖",Karine Mazet,2021-01-31T16:26:11Z,0

Wow that was such a challenge for me I nearly gave up half way through. Suddenly being alone with myself and my thoughts made it really difficult for me to connect to my breath and just lacked motivation hugely. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m quite ready to practice without a guide yet.,Hannah Sophie,2021-01-31T16:25:53Z,1
"Wow. In the other challenges, I would do a lot of poses during day 30, but I ended up focusing for I&#39;d say more than half of the practice on my breath. I think this 30 day journey just brought me new tools to trust and return to my breath. Thank you so much Adriene &lt;333",sarajinki,2021-01-31T16:25:02Z,0
"I was a bit reluctant and apprehensive today, thinking how will I manage without Adriene&#39;s voice as a guide?  But wow, today was special.  I&#39;ve been doing YWA since lockdown began in March, and today it&#39;s like its hit me that I&#39;ve found my own practise... and I enjoy it. Today was just me and my breath, not fitness or fancy moves or showing off.  Like a little moment of peace. I hope you all feel some peace too!

I&#39;ve loosely followed your calendars for various months over the years but this is the first time I have followed all 30 and did this final practice with you and the community. It was so satisfying to sequence my own flow for each side and lean into where my body wanted to go. There was even a time when I looked up and we were both in cobra!

"thank you, adriene (and benji), for helping me establish a kind inner voice, for making yoga a part of my life that i suddenly don’t know what i’d do without, for connecting me with my breath, and for showing me that all i need is within me. and thank you to everyone who has been with me alongside this journey for getting me through the hardest days.",Ila Kerchenski,2021-01-31T16:12:48Z,3

This was my first 30 day challenge and I loved it. I was pleasantly surprised that the last day was without Adriene&#39;s inspirational guidance in words. What I learned was the awareness and confidence she provided in the prior 30 days was all that was needed to complete the last day. Looking forward to many more exchanges and continuous learning. Thank you Adriene for all that you do for this community. We appreciate your positive energy in these negative times.,Sandra Sculli,2021-01-31T16:11:59Z,0

"I can’t believe how much stronger I’ve gotten from this journey. At the beginning, doing one plank was difficult, now I can do several planks throughout a practice with ease. I feel more flexible, and I definitely gained a lot of respect and trust in myself for showing up every day and finishing it. I decided to commit to this mainly because I have ADHD and a chronic illness and finishing a commitment is extra challenging for me. I feel so proud of myself for completing this, and so happy for this new daily habit. I will definitely be continuing to practice daily.

"Adriene - today I felt myself fully arrive into my whole being. For the first 25 years of my life, I lived my everyday life as a cisgender gay male. Recently, after my 25th birthday, I realized that these strict gender categorizations were limiting my happiness - being told by society that I am a gay man when I felt this wasn&#39;t quite right. Through my Wicca practice and yoga, I began to feel more aligned with the term &quot;non-binary.&quot; This was a revelatory beginning for me, feeling my years of discomfort with my body, mind, and spirit start to spill out over the edges of societal confinements. Today during this practice, I embrace the beginning of my new journey as gender fluid, queer, and limitless. During this practice, I embraced my body and soul as it is - outside of myself and with the hundreds of thousands of other souls practicing with me. We are all limitless, we are all free, we are all HUMAN. From one Adrian to another Adriene, Namaste.",A D,2021-01-31T15:50:24Z,1

"I thought about switching to an older video for guided practice, but I stuck with this and found it worthwhile. This is partly being about realizing the knowledge you have gained about yoga practice and doing what feels good moment by moment. I&#39;d still rather be guided, but I appreciate this encouragement to find my own inner voice.",Lokilicious,2021-01-31T19:35:13Z,1
"@Katie Deutsch you&#39;re correct, the point is to not look at the screen and to follow your own intuition. I usually just have a quick glance at the screen if I&#39;m stuck on where to go next but the rest of the time I&#39;m in my own little flow. It can be daunting at first but once you get going your body usually knows what to do :)",MsSmurflover,2021-01-31T18:41:22Z,0
"On the final days of these 30-day journeys, the idea is actually to NOT look at the screen. You have to trust in yourself and use the knowledge you&#39;ve built through this journey to move through a practice that is entirely your own. Adriene is there to practice with you, but not to take you through what she is doing on screen. Try again and let your inner voice tell you what to do rather than trying to follow Adriene, and I bet you&#39;ll have a better experience. It can be scary at first, but it&#39;s very freeing and you&#39;ll feel wonderful at the end knowing that you allowed yourself to take the reins and listen to what your own body needs. Best of luck &lt;3",Erin Noelle,2021-01-31T18:27:51Z,1
"@Seana Yates Same here, been doing yoga for about 17 years. For me the guidance Adriene usually gives allows me to lose my thoughts and let go, I don&#39;t have to think about what to do next as I&#39;m informed of that. Choice can be frustrating. Of course is great to choose between plank or tabletop, modifications are welcome and I frequently make them, but a general guided session is what I crave.",SD Hurford,2021-01-31T18:07:33Z,0

It was so fun this time--my third year--to never miss a day.  It has lengthened my practice from 10-12 minutes to 20-30 minutes and I&#39;ve loved it.  Thank you!,Leanne Worwood,2021-01-31T15:48:57Z,10
"Thank you so much Adriene! Whenever you would ask “how do you feel?”, I wouldn’t quite know how to put it in words. But I do know this, I can’t wait everyday to do this with you. I look forward to continuing this journey with you. Namaste",becky padgett,2021-01-31T15:48:23Z,2
"This has been an incredibly transforming journey for me. I have never fully committed to a regular &quot;exercise&quot; routine of any kind. I went into this with a totally open mind and it has completely reshaped the way that I function on a daily basis. I feel empowered, mentally sharp and strong. Beginning each day with this practice has been such a gift, especially in these times. I can&#39;t thank you enough for your loving guidance.",Tami Frenduto,2021-01-31T15:47:46Z,0

Third year in the bag 🙏🖤. Thank you for always guiding us. Adriene I started and learned yoga because of you. I was always afraid to practice in front of others. Last year I found an in-person yoga community. It had been a personal goal of mine but was still nervous. Of course it&#39;s been outdoor and zoom practices but it&#39;s been so fulfilling. I thought I wouldn&#39;t be good enough to join but what I learned from this channel was more than enough. I&#39;m so grateful that Adriene and yoga have become these positive influences in my life. Namaste.,Alfredo Pasta,2021-01-31T15:45:18Z,2
"I missed half of this beautiful last day of yoga because I felt I had to keep one eye on the screen. For me, it would be better to have Adriene walk us through the poses so we could close our eyes and relax. Anyone feel this way? Can’t wait for tomorrow and see where the yoga will take us. Thank you Adriene for this wonderful 30 day BREATH journey.",Helen Valenzuela,2021-01-31T15:45:00Z,66
"Erin Noelle this is the first time I’ve completed a 30 day journey to its end. Throughout all of it, I’ve completely surrendered to the process, participating fully, feeling, and being present. Today’s video took all of that away from me. I feel disheartened. I told myself to surrender, but all it did was make me anxious as I felt I had to try and always anticipate the next move. Not knowing that the silent narrative was a tradition, I had no way to prepare myself mentally or emotionally. This is something I felt could have been trickled in throughout the 29 days somehow. Even if there was a very basic narration, maybe where she did a pre recorded voice over, or had someone else narrate. She is the teacher, who knows each move, so she can surrender into it. To inform us on the last day doesn’t give us a chance to prepare. I had so much negative narrative going on in my mind, and couldn’t do the breath work properly. I hate that I’ve come away from such an amazing journey, feeling deflated and disappointed. I felt very emotional at the end, not because it was over, but because after this entire month, I wasn’t able to enjoy the last day. I know her intentions were very meaningful, but in some ways I feel it missed the mark. I will still do her videos, and maybe somewhere down the track, I will try/try to be more present during the last day, but for now I will avoid the last day videos, as I don’t want to feel this way again at the end of another 30 day journey. This style obviously doesn’t work for everyone, and maybe some sort of compromise needs to be made, so some/many of us don’t walk away feeling like I do.",Cora Augusta,2021-01-31T20:23:53Z,0
"I felt more uncomfortable with it last year (my first YWA 30 Day challenge), but this time it was good. I had to just let go, and sometimes you are in a completely different place than she is. I had some weird « screw ups, » but they also worked for me. I’d keep peeking, too, but then I’d just stay a long time in certain poses or guess at the next part and end up somewhere similar. I can see how it’s not for everyone, but I  actually feel like there’s something really emotional about the silence. I felt like her unspoken cues and my inner cues melded.",Isabelle Jorgensen,2021-01-31T20:18:29Z,1
"@Erin Noelle That doesn&#39;t work for everyone, however. I am on the autism spectrum and while I get the point of not providing audio cues, my brain works differently. I can&#39;t freeform or improvise or just be creative on the spot. It&#39;s not about not trusting myself, I just cannot &quot;do my own thing&quot;. My brain just does not work that way.",Joanne McNair,2021-01-31T20:04:36Z,0
"Agreed. Besides, I don&#39;t come here to do a freestyle yoga flow. If I wanted that, I would just do yoga without going on youtube. Yoga is a place where i can typically let go of my frustrations and just focus on the guidance, today was the complete opposite for me. Stressful, annoying, and for the first time in this journey, I left the practice feeling worse than i did when I came in. Going to avoid these ones moving forward.",Joel Tietz,2021-01-31T19:35:00Z,5
"Yes. I did not breathe properly, I did not do all the poses, my neck hurt when I finally gave up because I was constantly trying to see the TV. If we have the vocabulary, then we need the words in my opinion.",Michele Lastovica,2021-01-31T19:33:09Z,0

"When Adriene turned off her mike, I was like WHAT? I still needed to see and hear what she was doing, because, well I guess I still needed direction. Is that weird? However as the practice continued I found my own pace (my inner voice). Adriene has inspired me to continue my practice and enjoy every moment. Thank you Adriene!",JANIS WHITE,2021-01-31T15:20:07Z,2
"This is my first 30 day challenge and although I understand the emotional and physical impact of a DIY practice, I’m a bit frustrated. This month has no practices that are this long, so after 20 minutes of genuinely soothing and wonderful practice on my own I checked how much time was left and was shocked and frustrated to see 30 minutes left; I felt prepared to do 15/-25 minutes, as we had done a lot of those, but I felt unprepared to do such a long practice on my own, despite on and off years of (guided) yoga practice. <br />Time cues or an optional audio track would be a big help for those of us who are either uninterested or unprepared for a practice like this. <br />Pretty sad to end a great journey without a guided practice. Would have loved for this to be say 29, and then end on a big note together, guided, for day 30. <br />I’ll be doing old 30 day of yoga months for the next 6 months, but might be skipping the final day of each.",Zoe Weinstein,2021-01-31T15:19:30Z,0

I’ve never made it to day 30 so I had no idea about the tradition.....<br />That was beautiful. The music was so soothing and it flowed. I felt so connected to the journey with this “ending”.

"I’m surprised to find myself tearing up as I finish this session and these 30 days. I was nervous and a little disappointed there wasn’t any audible guidance today, but once we started, my body knew what to do. I made small little adjustments on my own, I trusted my breath. We’re little little birds, ready to leave the nest. Adriene trusted us, we just had to trust ourselves. I’m so proud of myself. Of all of us. I didn’t realize what a gift this would be. Thank you, Adriene. You have given me so much.",Kristin Farwell,2021-01-31T15:07:29Z,34

"WOW. Adriene. THANK YOU for teaching me this month what the magic of yoga is. I&#39;ve always struggled with yoga; to be in the now, in the moment. I would always get restless, wishing the minutes would go by quicker. I never thought I&#39;d be able to do a 50 min yoga routine - if I saw that a video was longer than 20 mins I would never go for it, as I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of having to be &quot;still&quot; for that long. It just seemed impossible. I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve now managed to do a 30 day challenge with you and all the other wonderful people across the globe! <br />When you said in the beginning of the video that you wouldn&#39;t be guiding us in this one, I panicked. I&#39;ve gotten so used to having you in my ears, guiding me through every step of the way. Holding my hand. How would I be able to do 50 mins without you holding my hand? <br />I cried like a baby the first 10-15 mins of the practice. I don&#39;t know whether it was because I was scared and questioned if I could do this on my own, because of the absolutely beautiful music throughout the whole practice, or just because of the pure fact that you put your trust in me (us) that I (we) can do this on our own. Perhaps it was a combination of all of these factors. I just felt so touched. <br />Somewhere along the middle of the practice my crying finally subsided. I even surprised myself by remembering the names of the poses that we did. And I remembered to breathe. I must admit, it was hard to follow along the practice without having you in my ears, as I like to close my eyes when I do yoga, but I am very happy with my efforts. Once I heard the outro music coming on at the end I started crying again. I am so proud of myself. I did it!<br />This month was so worth it and I look forward to continuing. What an incredible journey you took us on. 🥺 Thank you again, Adriene. 🙏❤️️ (and a special thanks to the cutest thing Benji 🐕  as well that has made me smile throughout this journey) Sending my love from Sweden!

"After reading the email I thought she would take off the mic but we would still have guidance. When it started, I panicked cause she wasn&#39;t there lol... then when she stepped on her mat, I was like, oh, so we&#39;re supposed to just do our own thing?? I was apprehensive at first but decided to just go with what felt good! Sometimes I was in the same position and other times I just observed and got ideas for positions I&#39;d forgotten about. As others have stated, I felt the emotions arise throughout my practice and released them in the form of tears at the end.

"It&#39;s over!! After dedicate, this is the second time I finished a January YWA tradition in real time. Without Adriene&#39;s guidance my mind wandered the entire practice but I showed up!!

"Oh I am such a crank!  The one flaw in this series is the last day;  I barely look at the videos and I rely heavily on the verbal cues.  (I do most of it with my eyes closed, enjoying myself.)  Having to watch the video every moment for the longest, last day video is always such a challenge for me.  If you have it in your heart, send a cranky woman some love and grace as I do this.",Juanita Westaby,2021-01-31T14:45:40Z,0
"I&#39;m afraid I agree. I know it&#39;s designed as an opportunity to be free and tailor movement for yourself, but I would much rather be guided. Plotting my own course is not relaxing and I feel a bit seasick trying to look at the screen from all angles.",Angela Ashby,2021-01-31T19:01:18Z,0

"Adriene, your 30 day yoga journeys have been an absolute savior since Covid began.  I&#39;ve gone through all of them in 2020 (with the exception of the OG 30 day YWA challenge...it&#39;s next on the list), but this is the first one I&#39;ve done in real time with all the other YWA yogi&#39;s.  Normally sticking to something religiously for 30 days feels like a chore, but getting a new practice along with a love letter in my inbox each day in Jan. was a bright spot of sunshine.  Thank you for so generously sharing yourself (and Benji!).  All your practices are carefully crafted with love and intention.

In the recent practice where we tried crow pose again, I was a bit disappointed in myself/thinking &quot;okay well that proves it&#39;s never going to happen,&quot; and today when crow was brought in I was like &quot;ugh.&quot; But I did it!!! My first ever successful crow! Feeling victorious and emotional and just a lot of feelings after this one. Peace be with y&#39;all &lt;3",Katia Lichtenstein,2021-01-31T14:42:32Z,0

I have found that everything I/we bring to the mat is always in the forefront of my mind now - whether that be conscious breath, self-love, grounding, honor, or whatever else, I am always reminded to be present with myself. I have cultivated so much more awareness of myself and my surroundings. By making this a daily routine and committing to it, I have brought strength and positivity into my life. I cannot express enough gratitude for you, this community, and this practice. I am ready to take on another 30 days!!! With love and light, Raven. &lt;3",Raven ॐ,2021-01-31T14:39:51Z,0

I’m a little OC, so found it disconcerting to find myself doing a different move or getting out of sync with you— in which case I paused the video, returned to the breath, went through the poses, and got back in sync with you. So I ended up following your routine with a few extra moves interspersed throughout. Namaste!",Janet Cushing,2021-01-31T14:34:26Z,0

"It&#39;s really hard to put into words how I feel after this last practice😊 I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the beautiful background music or knowing that it&#39;s the last day and I really did my best, but it never ever felt easier to do the poses, everything went so smoothly,  no shaky planks, no losing my balance, deeper twists, more flexibility. Downward facing dog was never my favourite but today that was so easy as well, my heels even touched the ground sometimes and I could even stay in crow pose for almost 2 seconds 😀 I feel amazing, I see real results and I am proud of myself. Of course my poses are not perfect but I trust that I am exactly where I should be. <br />I will miss the live sessions but I will definitely continue with the monthly calendars. 🧘‍♀️<br />Sending lots of love to this beautiful community, keep it up, you&#39;re awesome!!! ❤<br />And Adriene, thank you from the bottom of my heart! ❤🙏",Júlia Bekő,2021-01-31T14:33:51Z,0

I was looking forward to this 30 day yoga journey since and I could just cry tears of joy. The amount of growth that your yoga has brought to me is unmatched. I am a better person because of it and can show up better for the people in my life. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to know myself better and to be kinder to myself.

I didn&#39;t cry, but I was doing my own thing for the whole video and hardly looked at Adriene at all, but her voice was in my head the whole time. At one point I walked backwards on my mat without looking down at my feet and with attitude, and then I did some knocking on heaven&#39;s door, and that was when I felt the most emotional to be honest, it made me feel so empowered, and this whole experience has been very empowering!

Like some others i always get emotional on the last day of the journey.  Then i manage to concentrate and then I realize whouah we&#39;re only half way and i don&#39;t know if i will handle on another chaturanga. Thank you so much Adriene. Lots of love from France.

"I love that there was music from some of her previous 30 day journeys. It just brought back some incredible memories and feelings. <br />I know that this journey will serve as the same memorable and unique experience. The focus on breath was something I didn’t know I would love as much as I have. And I cannot begin to express my gratitude towards Adrienne and her team for this journey, which I can tell has had so much time, effort and love put into it. Thank you so much!

"THANK YOU ADRIENE! I just finished Day 30 which turned into 36 min. practice for me. I always try to Focus on myself on Day 30 and listen to my body which movements it wants and needs on that Day (find what feels good right) while incorporating the things i learned on the journey and BREATH thought me so much!  Thank you again for this amazing videos, your teaching and your love for us. Thank you to the Community who always where here when i showed up for a new Video. This was the first 30 Day Journey i followed &quot;live&quot; and i have to say its even more special that way! I love you all and i&#39;m so proud that we&#39;ve come this far.

"I surprised myself at getting emotional when some of the old music came on around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwyEtS_7OQ&amp;t=14m30s"">14:30</a>, and Adriene looked at the camera. Of course, my emotional moment was followed by realizing that Adriene primarily looks at the camera on Day 30 to silently say &quot;get ready for this next one&quot;... 🙂 This is the fourth set of 30-day challenges I&#39;ve done with YWA during our alternate reality this past year, and the first one I&#39;ve done as it was released. It&#39;s been a wonderful journey as the year has begun and I am very grateful.",xopherma,2021-01-31T14:25:17Z,28

"I started this video lying on my bed, fully expecting to lay there the whole time in shavasana. Wtihin 30 seconds of you beginning your practice, I wanted to find what feels good and even more amazingly I knew what feeling good was going to be. I got up and managed 25 minutes of my own practice which I am honestly so content with. The breath did guide me and everything we have learned over the past 30 days was flowing through my mind, almost effortlessly.

It feels like the end of a play run...Part of you is ready to wrap, but part of you is yearning to continue. <br /><br />Admittedly I struggle with the self-practice -- in spite of having the vocabulary and many years of a yoga practice to draw upon. I ended up practicing a blend of Kundalini, Yin, and Yinyasa this morning.<br /><br /> Namaste to my fellow practioners, Benji, and beautiful Adriene!",Gina Marie,2021-01-31T14:09:20Z,0

"I love what you curate for us and I&#39;ve been following you for a long time and so happy that it has brought so many to the mat. I, unfortunately always dread the 30th day. I like the verbal cues...albeit sometimes a little more wordy than necessary - lol but I lost my breath today trying to crank my head around to try to follow. Finally I gave up and just did my own thing with the poses that help some of the reasons I come to the mat. And yes, I can hear you now Adriene, that&#39;s what I should be doing but it certainly wasn&#39;t flowy. I was proud to be able to push the reset button and stick with a daily practise this month and will continue. (Just skipping any of the Day 30 practises &lt;smile&gt;)",Linda Pogor,2021-01-31T14:06:14Z,0
"Same for me!  My solution has been to watch Day 30 and record my own narration of what Adriene is doing so I&#39;m not cranking my head to look at the video or losing pace with her.  It feels a little like cheating but I did it for the last 30-day series I did before this one, and it worked for me!  I just finished making my recording and am about to get on the mat.  Congrats on making it to Day 30! Namaste.",Lisa Gaughran,2021-01-31T14:13:29Z,1
"Thank you so much, Adriene! This is my third &#39;yoga journey&#39; that I&#39;ve tuned in for...Also getting emotional, here; to think I&#39;ve already spent a couple of years (kick-started by these journeys) fighting weakness and despair (due to mild scoliosis, misfortune, and my first personal exposure to tragedy) -- I&#39;m finally at a place where I can FEEL STRENGTH and inner support! <br />As a superstitious Aries, new beginnings are supposed to be my forte, yet I&#39;ve had such a hard time &#39;getting the feel&#39; of this...THE BREATH was the final piece! (It should have been the first!) &#39;Dedicate&#39; and &#39;Home&#39; allowed me to dig deep within, through all the tensions, twinges, discomforts and weirdness...&#39;Breath&#39; is creating that repetition that continues to pull my spine (and the rest of me) back to center.

It feels great to be part of such a lovely community &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",edoriin guanko,2021-01-31T13:49:19Z,0
"I have participated in each 30 Days of Yoga since the beginning and deeply appreciate the work that goes into making this happen. My only constructive feedback is for the final day to have some narration, as I find myself looking at the screen so much more to find out what&#39;s next. It would be lovely to have audio clues that note a shift to the next pose. Thank you.",Christina Erickson,2021-01-31T13:49:03Z,1

"I remember how dissapointed I was back in the day, when I did my first 30 days with Adriene and there where no prompts at day 30! I just did another random video, because I thought I can&#39;t do it on my own.<br />The next year I tried day 30 on my own, but it didn&#39;t feel very good. I looked at Adriene a lot and had to think really hard between poses, what to do next.<br />Then it got better every year! I learned to enjoy it and boy, did I love THIS day 30! 50 minutes, just me and my breath, eyes closed for a lot of the time and IT. FELT. SO. GOOD. I even broke a sweat, although nobody forced me too, just because I wanted to test my limits and see where my breath would take me.<br />Thank you, Adriene and Benji! &lt;3",K.

Now that I&#39;ve reached the end (but only the end of Breath and this particular journey) I feel sad. I feel happy. I feel strong. I&#39;ll need to be strong, to believe, to breeeeeeeaaaaaaathe for what comes next.  I shall roll out my mat again on 1st Feb... and beyond.  Indeed, today&#39;s practice is perfectly named - Begin - for it may be the end, but it&#39;s a beginning, making my way to what comes next. Stay safe. Stay well. Stay strong.

At times, on my own, at times looking over with Adriene seemingly following me, other times looking over and joining in a pose she was doing. Felt good to own the practice a little. Enjoy everyone! I am headed to the February calendar and am considering even doing at least one of the YWA foundational videos each week. ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🙏<br /><br />By the way, who else wanted to keep doing Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door for the rest of the time?

"I got the invitation. I Arrived on the mat. I anchored on my Breath and my Breath was my Anchor all the way. I Listened to every sensation of the body and my inner feelings and thoughts. I Replenished. I Burnt what no longer serves me. I Synchronized breath and movement. I Snuggled. I Balanced. I totally Connected. I Flowed at my own pace. I Dropped all expectations, control, anxiety. I Felt safe &amp; sound. I gave Space to my thoughts, my insecurities. I Entered my discomfort zone. I embraced Discipline as a means to evolve spiritually, emotionally and physically. I Explored new boundaries. I Centered on my Breath as my anchor. I Strengthened each day. I Paused to breathe and Find What Feels Good. I Controlled my Breath. I Renewed my practice. I Dedicated time to self-care daily. I Rejuvenated my mind, my spirit, my body. I Loved each moment of this journey. I Expanded my present moment. I Healed in ways I never imagined possible. I Trusted my journey, my progress, one day at a time. I Believed. O h. Yeah! I never stopped believing in myself, in my commitment. I Begin Today with profound gratitude for all that I am, all that I have and all that I need is inside me.

"@Anastasia Kalacheva Wow, there&#39;s no need to be so aggressive. Again I really wish you wouldn&#39;t keep saying my mindset is wrong and that I&#39;m being negative. I&#39;m really not. I&#39;m just explaining my experience and I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t understand that. There&#39;s really no need to respond in such an aggressive way to someone who&#39;s just trying to communicate her experience. <br /><br />I&#39;m not closed off to feedback at all. I&#39;m responding with an open heart and instead of attempting to understand me, you&#39;re ignoring what I&#39;m saying. You&#39;re not engaging with me. I&#39;m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt by being open and you&#39;re not willing to accept my experiences. Yoga is for everyone and those of us who don&#39;t come to yoga for the same reasons you do have just as much right to our experiences. If our experiences are negative, that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re wrong. That just means something isn&#39;t for us, and we&#39;re allowed to give our honest feedback about our struggles with it. I&#39;m sorry if you can&#39;t see that. Toxic positivity is harmful.",Prosateuse,2021-02-20T11:15:19Z,1
"@Prosateuse First of all, I really do not understand your tone and your wish to take everything as a personal attack. Multiple times in my comment I stated that what I&#39;m saying is a personal view or opinion or experience. I also stated that it simply might not be for some people, and some people do have the wrong mindset. The only time I directly referenced your mindset was when I said &quot;change your mindset that you&#39;re not succeeding&quot;. Which was a direct reference to your previous comment saying that you&#39;re feeling frustrated because you can&#39;t do it. Saying someone has the wrong mindset is not condescending. I myself have had a wrong mindset when it came to many things and was open to being corrected when someone pointed it out. <br /><br />Second - All I am trying to do is help you. Maybe you are in the same place I was a couple years or months ago, and maybe my suggestions will help. That is all. I am sharing my personal opinions, views, and experiences. <br /><br />Third - Adrienne provided a video as a stepping stone to do yoga all on our own. It&#39;s like a step between being guided fully by her, and doing all on our own. I already explained the purpose of the video. And it is not so we follow 100% of what she is doing.<br /><br />Fourth - If you don&#39;t like this format, then don&#39;t watch it. She has a channel rich with different length videos that do have cues.<br /><br />Fifth - You seem closed off fully to feedback. You stated that you do not understand the purpose and feel frustrated, yet when someone has tried to engage with you (in multiple comments), you reply in a manner that makes it clear you only want people of a similar opinion to be your &quot;yes&quot; man. And since I feel like if you don&#39;t understand my point after so many words, you never will, this will be my last comment here addressing you. <br /><br />I&#39;m sorry that you did not find this specific video helpful, but it is no reason to complain or be negative. It is easy to not be stubborn and simply choose to watch another video. Peace out.",Anastasia Kalacheva,2021-02-20T10:41:17Z,2
"@Anastasia Kalacheva  @Anastasia Kalacheva  I just feel like you&#39;re not understanding what many people get out of yoga that they can&#39;t get without a set flow. I enjoy yoga because I can move and turn my mind off. So like many others I find this frustrating, because constantly pausing to work out what to do next is the opposite of what I come to yoga to achieve. I have to think about what to do next, and remember what I did before, so I can balance it out on the other side. I have to count to remember how long I held for, so I can repeat that. It&#39;s not the experience that I usually get from yoga. I rush, I get frustrated, and it&#39;s just unpleasant. So I do yoga videos. Asking myself &quot;what do I want to do now?&quot; after every movement is an unpleasant experience. I don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to do anything. &quot;Want&quot; is not why I come to yoga. <br /><br />What you&#39;re saying is that I didn&#39;t enjoy it because of my &quot;mindset&quot;.  That I should sit and breathe because I can&#39;t look at the video and do yoga at the same time. I want to do the sequence! Adriene wouldn&#39;t have provided one if we were just meant to ignore it. <br /><br />I get that you don&#39;t understand what I and many others look for in a yoga video but we shouldn&#39;t be condescended to as just having the wrong mindset if the video doesn&#39;t work for us.",Prosateuse,2021-02-20T10:19:56Z,1
"@Prosateuse hi again! I never said that you don&#39;t trust yourself or your body. I was just trying to put into words what I thought the message was, and the practice was about. <br /><br />I fully recognize that this day 30 might just be unsuitable for a small portion of people. But I feel like a portion just also get lost in the wrong mindset. I&#39;ve been there myself! I used to think that I had to do a flow that is structured and coherent. A flow that Adrienne would do! But after just finishing my day 30 practice, I realised that it is NOT about that. Like Adrienne said in the beginning, even if you just breathe for 50 minutes, it&#39;s okay! The main point is to get onto the mat and be there for the duration of the practice. No matter what you actually do on the mat. For example, today I breathed for a good 10-20 minutes. Did some gentle twist and side stretches while seated ( just because they&#39;re my favourite moves). Took longer than usual in cat-cow (because I never feel like I get enough during the structured lessons). Then wanted to get into a flow so I did a couple low lunge and down dog series. Arms started to hurt, so instead of doing belly down to cobra, I remembered that I really liked chair pose and other leg-oriented poses. So I did those. Arms felt a bit more rested so I did high lunges (as a step up/ more progressed than low lunges). Exhausted after, so laid in child&#39;s pose. Then did some boats and abs (again, just because I felt like it). Then I ran out of inspiration so I glanced at Adrienne and she was doing crows pose. So that reminded me that I wanted to try that, as well as the low squat and toe stand! So I did those in my own time and when I came down to corpse pose, Adrienne has already been in it for a while.<br /><br />Reason I wrote all that out, is because I never actually planned any of those poses ahead of time. I came to the mat. Sat down and started the way Adrienne did as a way to guide me into the practice. Then from there, after every movement, I asked myself &quot;what do I want to/ feel like doing now?&quot; Sometimes, I&#39;d remember a pose or sequence in the middle of doing another one and just do that one next! When I had a sequence I wanted to do but my muscles got too tired, I just let myself have a child&#39;s pose or other resting posture so I could go into that one next. Or I all-together went into another posture that concentrated on another part of my body.<br /><br />Again, I totally understand that this might not be suitable for some people. And this is not me trying to tell you that you&#39;re doing anything wrong. I&#39;m just trying to give my personal view. And perhaps trying to change your mindset that you&#39;re not succeeding to a mindset of maybe today was just a &quot;sit and breathe&quot; day for you. Personally, every time I feel like I&#39;m not doing enough, I remind myself that Adrienne has given us 10-20 minute pure breathing videos before. And that despite not moving much or at all besides breathing, I still learnt something new about myself.<br /><br />Again, I understand how it can be frustrating. I myself have done the 30 days series for 4 times before finally lasting the whole 50 minutes confidently this time around.",Anastasia Kalacheva,2021-02-20T10:07:03Z,1

You are beautiful, loved &amp; hardworking. It took me the whole journey to rid myself of the fear of coming to the mat. I have never been the sort for any form of physical activity and this lingering fear of failure of pain is always at the back of my mind. I&#39;ve been working on it for a while now but only through this journey have I been able to overcome it. I feel ready for more. I will  be on the mat tomorrow perhaps even for the rest of my life. Life is so short..... XOXO.  Please leave me a reply!!To all who have made it on the mat even if once this month, well done. If you have any fears know, y ou can do it. Hear it from me an ex-couch potato the hardest part is getting on the mat❤❤❤Do",Do!lo,2021-01-31T13:19:25Z,0

"Thank you so much for helping foster a yoga vocabulary for us around our breath, Adriene! I love how you treat us to this final day full of the music from prior 30 days of YWA... it’s a special reminder of practices past that often brings a tear of gratitude to my eye. <br /><br />Also you know I did a healthy amount of knocking on heavens door and self massage in the self guided practice, and it was most excellent",Dr. Silvestri,2021-01-31T13:17:55Z,0
Just finished this practice and I felt so many things over this 50 minutes!

Anyone else find that completely impossible &amp; frustrating? How are we meant to follow along with no guidance when the positions mean we can’t see the screen? I couldn’t relax into any posture because I had to keep my eyes on the screen the whole time. At first I thought the music was going to change slightly every time there was a change (which would have been a great idea)  but it stopped doing that after the first few changes.<br /><br />I love YWA and have really enjoyed the journey but this was a frustrating end. Maybe have a ‘watch Adriene do yoga’ video as a bonus at the end but not as the final day for everyone.,Rebecca Cartwright-Teakle,2021-01-31T12:52:49Z,0
These mic-off practices are always a bit daunting but I really enjoyed this one! I followed the main structure of your practice but I also made my own decisions. The most fun part was when I thought to myself for example that a chair pose would fit nicely here and moments after you went into chair pose! It felt like we were almost connected at times☺️ Thank you Adriene for this beautiful journey❤,Vilma Virtanen,2021-01-31T12:52:42Z,0

"Namaste &amp; thank you Adriene. Always a bit scary when going solo but so good to follow your lead, to have a sequence to follow. Found myself doing my own thing on occasions - yeah! Also found that I was conscious of my breathing as I kept coming back to thinking about it as I moved between postures.  I&#39;m doing a lot of vocal work this month so working with my breath and body has been a real help.  As ever this is a great way to start the year. May the rest of 2021 be as fulfilling for everyone xx",Marie-Louise Sessions,2021-01-31T12:43:02Z,0

I had hoped to have the journey end together doing the same poses but as is tradition we end on our own journey.  Kind of a symbol for how things are now we are all having to learn to embrace the solitude and be comfortable with ourselves and that we are on this journey alone people may be on the same path but ultimately we must find our own way.   It brought me great peace the last 30 days and I am sad to see it end.,Janine Sorrell,2021-01-31T12:42:27Z,0

It can can be a beautiful beginning of something beyond that , let’s HOP INTO SOMETHING COMFY  and get on another journey in February, nothing is there to stop us Adriene provided the vocabulary , we have got the breath to guide us .it’s amazing what progress I’ve made with my strength and my body flexibility I persevered showed up every day for myself and I am grateful for it to you Adriene and to myself . Today felt like everything came together, a beautiful dance , a party, it felt familiar and my own to keep . A party requires a drink so I made a yogi tea 🍵 that you made 3 years ago , I am raising a toast with it to You and to all in the community, we are champions...Namaste",lidia budzinska,2021-01-31T12:37:32Z,0

"Warning: Sappy post!  As we began today&#39;s practice, I started following you just as every other morning before.  Your prompts were whispering in my head as we moved.  &quot;Begin to gently deepen your breath, marry the effort with ease, find what feels good.&quot;  At some point, I stopped and just began watching the video (probably not what we were supposed to do, but . . . . ), I became overwhelmed with gratitude for your beautiful soul and how this practice has grown into a sacred time that I look forward to and can hardly go one day without.  About that time, Benji was at the window and you unfolded your blanket and patted it for Benji to come lay down which he did.  I was almost in tears.  And then I began listening. I could not only hear your prompts, but also my guide within.  From that point on, I didn&#39;t try to follow your lead, but did what came to me naturally and what I felt like my body and soul needed.  Then you were doing &quot;knocking over heaven&#39;s door&quot; and I was like, &quot;No, wait for me!&quot;  LOL!  I met up with you and moved on through the practice with a smile and much gratitude for all those on this journey together.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart in East Tennessee!",April Ball,2021-01-31T12:35:59Z,0

When I saw how long the video was I was pretty skeptical of my own abilities, but hey. We made it. At one point I laughed out loud because I glanced at the screen to see what Adriene was doing and we were doing the exact same thing. <br /><br />Thanks again for these videos.

"26-32K. I can&#39;t believe I did it. Starting this journey was something that got me really excited because I started yoga last May 2020 and had trouble making time for practicing because I did not have the discipline to push through. I had bad habits and I just wanted to push and see how I could transform my mind and soul if I commit 30 days of putting aside time to do this so I could love and listen to my body more. This journey had its ups and downs but I am so glad I did it. I know I shared this practice with millions of people and I just wanna say I&#39;m proud because we all did this!! ❤ Thank you so much, Adriene!",Kimberly Uy,2021-01-31T12:14:51Z,0

I would like to keep doing the 30 day programs and am wondering which you recommend to best follow this one?,Beth Ondrus,2021-01-31T12:14:20Z,0
"What a way to end 30 days of YWA. I could feel the shift during this last class...I just followed my intuition and often times I was right along with Adriene as she wordlessly guided us..probably because I could hear her words in my head. The sign of a great teacher. Other times I just did my own thing, and that was pretty empowering.I was a bit worried that 50 mins would be too long, because in Dec I would&#39;ve found even 20 mins to be a long session..I&#39;m not usually one to move slowly or just sit in stillness. But I noticed how I was just marinating and soaking up all the delicious moments, savouring my breath. When the intro music came on in the end, and we brought our hands to the third eye, I felt tears in my eyes. What a way to begin this year. Thank you Adriene, thank you team for putting together this program, and thank you for practicing with me. Namaste.🙏💕✨",Chantal Wright,2021-01-31T12:13:54Z,0

"First I&#39;d like fo.say THANK YOU for these 30 days, but for me the last day was very hard. Trying to follow a flow when you&#39;re visually impaired and/or in any backward facing move is practically impossible. I came away more stressed and knotted up than anything else.",Keely jackson,2021-01-31T12:12:23Z,1

"We did it! Woohoo! 30 days of yoga and it’s been an amazing journey. I started this with my husband and we did it. Since my hubby is new to yoga, he decided to follow me for this one and I’m so happy to say that I was able to carry out a “class” without even putting on the video during our session together! Thank you Adriene for this. It truly has been life changing for my husband and I. I look forward to continuing my yoga journey for the rest of the year! Thanks again!",Natasha Ilyas,2021-01-31T12:11:50Z,1
"Dearest Adriene, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this wonderful, magical, life-changing journey! 💗 I simply love starting a new year with you, 30 days of yoga and the thoughtful love letters each day! I could feel the love you put into each of the days and I felt tears of happiness and thankfulness at the end of every single video. 💗 This was the most amazing 30 days journey! I learned so much from you (especially about my breath) and I dearly hope that you will continue doing this for the next decades to come! Lots of love from snowy Sweden, Lea 💗",Lea,2021-01-31T12:10:58Z,0

"I feel so proud of myself and all of you for completing this journey. I amazed myself today by having the best practice of this 30 days. I had no trouble flowing through this 1 hour free style practice; if that isn&#39;t a testament of all the things I&#39;ve learned this month...! I was aware of my breath for an hour and when I felt like shifting through to another pose I stayed for two more cycles of breath, for good measure. :) I challenged myself with difficult poses, but also really enjoyed all the time I wanted for my favorite ones. I even found myself rewinding the video, because I wasn&#39;t finished yet! And my mind barely wandered from the practice. The music really helped with that. Thank you Adriene for this wonderful experience. And now we BEGIN with Bridge - February!",Milou de Bruijn,2021-01-31T12:08:35Z,1

Thanks  for a great series on the breath. This is my least favorite day as it is the end of the series and I had to constantly look at the screen. I usually keep my eyes closed and listen to the guidance. Today my alignment and focus was off as I had look at the screen for direction.

When I couldn’t find joy in anything I found myself seeking the mat. Really, thank you Adriene.<br><br>During this challenge I found out that I especially enjoy ujjayi breath. It lets me imagine ocean waves. This last practice really let me explore that. As I breathe in I imagine being the ocean itself and pulling the water back and it makes me feel grand and powerful. As I breathe out I imagine myself on the beach as soft warm waves engulf me and I can actually feel a gentle warm sensation come over my body. It was so beautiful. In this practice I also found out I can actually close my eyes and balance on one foot now!",1 q,2021-01-31T11:51:49Z,0

"Beautiful practice and an amazing journey we have all shared in! I got emotional when I got on the mat today. A lot of feelings pouring out. Very surprised at how quickly that 45 minute self practice went by. Ive been practicing YWA for 3 ish years now and this was the first year I completed the 30 days in order, adding several other videos to each day to the practice 60-90 mins per day. There were tough days, but feel my practice has grown a lot in the last 30 days. The past three years of yoga have been life changing to say the least. Getting on the mat is the one time I can find unity between mind, body and soul. That exquisite stillness is truly sublime. One of the beautiful things about yoga is that there is always room to grow. Every ending is a new beginning! Words of wisdom from a true master. Thank you for your teachings and insight always. And of course, I’ll still see you tomorrow on the mat 😉 Wishing peace of mind and good vibes to all my fellow friends of Yoga With Adriene across the world!

"We made it. 30 days, including working with a fractured wrist!  Well done every one. Last year I completed the 30 days and went on to practice everyday with the YWA calendars until 8 December when I slipped and fractured my wrist.  This 30 day journey has me back into my daily practice and I intend to get through the year this year. The few days in December without yoga really highlighted to me the benefit of the daily practice so thank you Adriene and  your YWA team for giving us the tools and thank you everyone that I practice along with.",Cathy Martucci,2021-01-31T11:38:39Z,1
"What an amazing journey!!!! 🤩<br />I started 10 mins of mediation, and was like huh it couldn&#39;t be that long, so I checked you Adriene and was already started with yoga. I was like <b>lmao</b> 😂 and even my stomach was waiting for having a breakfast. <br /><br />At the end, which is actually only the beginning like in Hinduism and Buddhism, I felt like I was in in balance overall and did a great job for doing a 50 mins exercise. All thanks to you Adriene and all the yogis out there! 😍🙏🏽 <br /><br />I wish everyone a great new beginning in 2021 and hope for the best that covid will dissapear soon. Only time will tell ;) Namaste! 💫🙏🏽🍀",Noah Liasam,2021-01-31T11:38:39Z,1

"This year was my first year to do the Jan 30 days in real time and I LOVED IT!!! The last day is normally not my favorite but this time I really enjoyed it. Did i keep my eyes open the whole way through and copy everything Adriene did - sure. Did I have to take breaks and sometimes forget to breathe - also sure. But did I enjoy the practice and feel great afterwards - yes! And if there’s anything I’ve learned from Adriene the past year is to go at my own pace and find what feels good for me 😊 Thank you Adriene for an amazing series and all the work that goes into it. It’s always sad when they are finished but I look forward to continuing in Feb. Lots of Love from Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪💚😊<br /><br />Also the soundtrack for this video was amazing, hoping its on the Spotify playlist!? If not I will be playing this video whenever I need some beautiful relaxing background music!! Loved hearing all the tracks from the previous 30 day series!

"Omg it&#39;s actually day 30 🥺 This was the first time I tried Yoga and honestly I didn&#39;t think I would make it when I started, because I already tried a lot of other 30 day challenges/journeys where I tried to lose weight or something. But for this new year I found, that I&#39;d like to primarily do something for the soul and my mental health, so I found you. I&#39;m so thankful for being able to do this journey with all of you wonderful souls, because I feel like it changed me so much, everything in life seems more manageable and I&#39;m less stressed in general. I feel like there&#39;s so much more love and piece in my soul, for the people around me as well as for myself (which took a looong time). Also, although this time it wasn&#39;t my main goal, I feel like I got much stronger and fitter! I noticed, that a lot of practices, that were hard for me in the beginning, became easier over time, which just shows me again, how consistency and basically just showing up every day is key. I again just want to say thank you to Adriene and to all the yogis around the world. Thanks for doing this together and all of your supportive and loving comments ❤️❤️❤️",Celä P.,2021-01-31T11:28:04Z,0

"Day 30: Begin. ‘If you’re unsure of how to begin, always start with a new breath’. Beauty is in essence. The beauty that we are all here. The beauty that we all practiced together. The beauty that each one of us was in this journey together. I have loved every bit of this entire journey and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I started this, feeling emotional. I really didn’t want this to end. This journey has had and always will have a special place in my heart. These days have allowed to me grow, to become who I am, to love myself, to be in my own skin and to cherish those around me. I couldn’t ask more from a journey. Many thank yous to our beloved guides Adriene and Benji. It’s true, ‘every end is new beginning’ so I hope to return to the mat soon. I love you Adriene and Benji. I love you everyone.

But I started breathing and then everything else followed smoothly. I was getting a bit worried midway through but at the end, I was amazed by how fast time passed. I am so grateful to Adriene and the whole team for setting up this month of pure joy, it helped me in so many different ways. It made me realise the true power of breath and my true strength.

But I did it, we did it, we completed something and it feels truly magical<br /><br />During corpse pose at the end, I kept saying to myself out loud that I am giving myself kindness, care and compassion over and over. Some moments I would hesitate in the sentence but each time I completed it, I felt a weight chip away. <br /><br />Adriene and everyone on this journey with me, you have helped me way more than you will ever know and for that, I thank you.

"We just filled 50min of yoga with our own knowledge and trust and I&#39;m super proud of everyone, who has come this far! I discovered Yoga in the summer of 2020 and straight away started the HOME Journey, which I just finished on the 31st of December haha. On that day I was pretty lost after 15min and today, exactly 31 days later, I filled the 50min! Thank you Adriane for allowing your audience this safe and sacred space! This was just the beginning!! ❤️❤️✨",Ella Pennt,2021-01-31T11:02:09Z,0

I&#39;m so grateful for an opportunity to be a part of this challenge again but I&#39;m also a bit relieved it&#39;s our last day. I&#39;m ready for my own practice, I missed it and couldn&#39;t wait.<br /><br /><br />I hope we can meet next year, maybe a bit happier and more free, without too many worries. <br /><br />This is my favourite quotation: &quot;Listen - are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life?&quot; I keep thinking about it a lot. Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you so, so much Adriene (and Benji). It&#39;s been an amazing journey. And it&#39;s much easier to breathe♥",Osoroshii,2021-01-31T10:55:19Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for the past 30 days, it was an honor to practice with you and even though I couldn&#39;t follow every practice I feel like I have grown so much and learned so many new tools. I was nervous to practice alone today, but it worked out so well and I cannot believe I just invented my own 50 minute yoga practice. I especially loved learning about the breath and new breathing techniques, which I will incorporate into my daily life, especially in anxious moments. I am getting really emotional because I was able to find a new source of joy in my life thanks to this 30 day journey. I cannot wait for new practices and new experiences.

"I’m sure I’m not the only one here to say, this series has gotten me through the month. Without this series I don’t know how I would have coped with how horrible this January has been. For those people coming to this in the future, where the trauma we’ve been through has faded from recent memory, it was traumatic to live through such a time. Each day brought with it a barrel of negative news, which I will not go into here. But each day also brought a new video. And boy, did I use that time to reset myself. To centre and reconnect. To remember that there is good in the world. <br /><br />To all my fellow participants, seeing your comments each day also renewed my faith that the world IS a good place. Thank you to each and every one of you who took the time to say something. Your words touched more people than you’ll ever know. <br /><br />And finally, to Adriene, Benji, and all the people behind the scenes at YWA, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You saved me.<br /><br />Namaste 🙏🏻",Hayley L,2021-01-31T10:53:06Z,0

"I want from the bottom of my heart to say thank you for this journey. I have learned so much and feel so thankful for getting to experience this. When I started I didn&#39;t know what to expect. My goal was to introduce a new routine to my everyday and to move my body. I recieved so much more. BREATH helped me deal with my grandmother passing away which I didn&#39;t know how to handle. After each practice the first two weeks I cried and felt like I could really let go of the sorrow I felt. It was a complete new feeling to me and instead of only feeling sorrow I felt grateful for the time I got to spend with her. <br /><br />I learned that I can do much more than I could ever imagine and feel so proud of my self for doing this for me. I also feel proud because I&#39;m doing this out of self love, this time is purely for caring for my body and mind.<br /><br />Thank you for creating this for us. For teaching and sharing your knowledge and wisdom. Thank you for taking the time and spending the energy to create BREATH.<br /><br />And thank you to everyone who has been on this journey and to everyone commenting and writing about your thoughts and experiences. I really felt supported by all of you and honored to hear about your journeys.",Maja V,2021-01-31T10:32:02Z,0

This 30 day practice has honestly got me through January, and I know I&#39;ll slowly but surely be bringing what I&#39;ve learnt into my life. I&#39;ve never been able to easily just sit with myself present with mind and body, and now, even if it&#39;s just a minute of surrender I can. Thank you Adriene for a wonderful 30 days, and I can&#39;t wait to join in on Bridge x",Susannah Bramwell,2021-01-31T10:29:38Z,0

"Thank you Adriene!<br />This was my fourth time participating in the YWA 30 Day Journey and it is always a pleasure to return to the roots and find something new. The breath work in this one really opened another door for me.<br />Also, it was both nostalgic and reassuring to hear the theme songs of past journeys being played in the background for this Begin practice.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who made this incredible community experience possible!<br />See you breathing on and off the mat.<br />Namasté.",KitaruSao,2021-01-31T10:28:56Z,0

"I remember when I did Home last year that day 30 really frustrated me and I spent most of it crying because I didn’t trust myself enough to just listen to my body and not receive direction from someone. It mainly frustrated me because at that point I had been doing yoga for a year and I felt I should have been better.<br />Another year on and I fully trusted myself and my breath to take me through the practice. The couple of times I did look up at the screen, I happened to be about to do the same post which brought a smile to my face. Instead of tears of frustration, I just had a couple of tears of almost joy! So thank you so much Adriene (and Benji) and the lovely community for being so supporting and wonderful! 💜",Lefranzine,2021-01-31T10:28:02Z,0

(One suggestion if I may be so bold!  Would it be possible to put a chime or some audible signal that you’re transitioning during the silent day 30 flow?  I think it’s a beautiful way to end the BREATH journey but I did crunch my neck trying to see when you were moving on, especially in downward facing dog!).

"A 50 minutes session to end and begin what a wonderful gift ! Thank you Adriene. It is so well designed, we reviewed everything you introduced to us during the month, it allowed to find ease, to notice the transformation and observe how all unfold wonderfuly ! Thank you again Adriene, thank you for how you serve and what you transmit and share from different plans, layers. I particuarly appreciated the session on center and this one from the all month. Yet it is  thanks to the nice combination of all the sessions that I can say that. It is because you showed up and we showed up every day that we can appreciate what Yoga propose to cultivate, it is both an introduction and a additional practice to our journey.

Instead, I ended up working through those remaining 20 minutes, repeating a few things and adding a little variation. It felt so good!

"It has been wonderful to wake up every morning for 30 days to spend the first moments of my day with Adriene, Benji and this kind community of like-minded people. It was incredibly motivating to breathe and be in it together so of course i feel a bit sad today that it&#39;s come to an end. But I&#39;m looking forward to continue with my practice thanks to Adriene&#39;s 1000s of videos and I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll have something new to unite us again soon. Yesterday i was recommended by YouTube a video of Benji as a puppy when Adriene introduced him for the 1st time 6 years ago. What a treat! It was the perfect gift to end this month on a high of cuteness 😍. Keep breathing all and thanks for your lovely company 🙏💗",Sophie Colling,2021-01-31T10:12:31Z,0

"Just finished the Beginning. I am sitting here crying my eyes out. My first time doing the 30-day-challenge- I freaked out when I heard that there were no instructions today because I just could not trust myself to &quot;think about the poses&quot; without a voice guiding me. The first twenty minutes I almost cramped trying to be in sync with Adriene. And then I started breathing and focussed on what I want, what I need. I am an absolute beginner in yoga and as with every exercise I start I thought I needed precise and ongoing instruction. Today for the first time in my life I found out that I just have to listen to my body and to my mind- they show me what they want. And my breath guides me through. I still am amazed how this went. I don´t think from now on I will just snap a finger and get in sync, but everytime I think I &quot;fail&quot; I can and will remember this half hour I was in sync with my body, my breath and myself.<br />Thank you, Adriene. Although I look forward to do more yoga WITH your voice guiding me, I now know I already have some tools to find peace and moments of calmness when I need them. The most important one: Breath. My breath is my anchor. My anchor is my breath.",Judith Schäfer,2021-01-31T10:07:04Z,1

I’m so proud of myself and everyone else that made it to the end! Lovely Adrienne, I wanna thank you so much for everything! You’ve changed my life.

"❤️ Two days ago it was my 9 monthiversary of &quot;every day Yoga with Adrienne&quot;. Thank you so very much, Adrienne,  for bringing yoga in such an inspiring way to ALL of us (no matter of gender and age). Thank you for helping us find &quot;what feels good&quot;, for teaching us how to accept and love our body, how-to, with a breath, receive and give love. Thank you for all your giggles and singings, that made us smile, and relaxed us and reminds us that we all are so very human. And Thank You Benji for letting us mentally pet you and squeeze you and sometimes distract our attention ❤️ Thank you, all the people for sharing your energy and love ❤️ Greetings from Switzerland",michelle h.,2021-01-31T09:59:29Z,0

"Thank you for this journey! It is so interesting, whenever I have followed these 30 days of yoga with you, I always get very anxious when we are at day 30. I have a very hard time not being guided when I dont know what im doing. It is very clear that I dont trust myself. Eventhough im all alone doing this, Im still afraid that I cant follow along, eventhough I have practiced yoga with you for almost 3 years now. So this time I thougt, just watched a bit of it, so you have an overview of what is going to happen, and that actually helped. Im so happy that I found my own way of dealing with this. I dont need to be uncomfortable, it is ok to know what works for me. And then maybe over time, I begin to trust myself in the unknow, and maybe not. For me it has been so so important to feel what works for me, and not make it a problem. And this journey of &quot;Find what works for you&quot; has helped me alot. Lots of love from Denmark. See you soon.",A z a d e h,2021-01-31T09:55:04Z,1

Starting to work again during the summer, my yoga became harder to complete. But I proud to say that this month work and yoga found a balance! It’s all because of the incredible guidance from the lovely Adriene and this amazing community. Don’t ever under estimate what we do here. It changes lives and souls.

BREATH was a journey of the heart, medicine for the soul that changed me. It help me to cultivate and honor my light, love, truth, beauty and peace that it is within me. Aware of these things brought me valuable gifts, an opportunity to trust my intuition and follow the path I belong to. I&#39;m much stronger now knowing that we are united. May all our burdens and fears be released. I&#39;ll keep showing up on the mat like I&#39;ve been doing since past May. Not afraid to bloom.

I know it&#39;s the main point of what teacher is ultimately trying to achieve. &quot;The student&quot; can perform on their own.. However, I miss the sound of your voice. Always positive. encouraging, non judgemental with a sense of fun. In the same way I keep my TV switched off these days. It&#39;s on the shelf. It no longer serves. I have made room for YWA because it makes me feel good and is in tune with the way I think, and speaks to me with kindness. I did my best with todays &quot;present moment&quot; but I look forward to the next moment which will come tomorrow. Namaste.",sunnyrovers,2021-01-31T09:38:58Z,0

"It may have been around September of 2015 when I first found your channel. I had wanted to learn yoga to help rehabilitate my body after a significant weight loss and to help kind of smooth everything out, because, at the time, I was working a largely sedentary job. I had no idea, then, that yoga would become such a huge part of my life. I practice daily, now, thanks to you. The time I spend on the mat helps bring a balance into my life, and helps mitigate the stress of working in Emergency Services. This was the first time you saved my life.<br /><br />Towards the end of November last year, you saved my life again. I had taken a fall after a practice (well, during, but the fall kind of cut that short), and had gone to the bathroom to get cleaned up, where I fell again, and hit my head on a radiator. I remember darkness, I remember cold, and I remember a tiny spark of... something, which came to me as the sound of your voice, telling me to listen to the sound of my breath. It was then I realized I wasn&#39;t breathing. If it wasn&#39;t for the memory of your voice... well... I may not be typing this. <br /><br />So proud of you, for being consistent, for sticking with it all through so many years, proud of the growth you&#39;ve made since squeaky old floor.<br /><br />Thank you, for everything &lt;3",Kevin Irizarry,2021-01-31T09:28:49Z,0

"Wow Adriene, I made it to Day 30 ! There was lots of peeping at the video throughout this practice so as to keep up, how long do we relax for 🤔 ? By adjusting here and there, missing out the chaturangas, going to knees, then downward dog, this senior yogi could carefully follow through. My side dips in forearm plank were non existent, but that didn’t matter. So proud to have made it to the end. I was expecting an hour but 51 minutes was just right for this mirroring sequence. Feeling emotional, especially when we knocked on heaven’s door 🙏☺️Now I’m off to download the February calendar 😃 sending love and gratitude dear Adriene and Benji 💕 🙏 see you tomorrow morning on the mat 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️💕💕",Gill Smith,2021-01-31T09:28:07Z,0

"This month has proved a real rollercoaster for the world and myself personally, with a mental burnout at the beginning of the month, resulting in me ending my relationship and moving from lockdown London back closer to my family in Sweden - showing up on the mat each morning has not only made me find a warm ground to rebuild myself from but it’s truly brought a whole new sense of purpose to my life. I am so extremely thankful for your work, Adriene, and I’m so humbled and honoured to be part of this incredible community. The tears that are rolling down my face after today’s yoga are tears of happiness! <br />Thank you SO much Adriene, you’ve truly enriched my life and I so look forward to continuing showing up on the mat each day. With much love - namaste xx",Irma Holmgren,2021-01-31T09:25:32Z,0
"I&#39;m about to complete the final day my first ever full 30 days of yoga.... I cant believe I got here, I&#39;m so happy, I never thought I would make it 😭 I tried last year but I found I was dealing with some serious negative self talk and having to argue with myself to keep going, here were lot of tears...needless to say it was exhausting and after 10 days I gave up. I havent attempted yoga again until this years, even though I&#39;ve wanted to every day. I cant believe how much I enjoyed this year... i have an aim now to complete a yoga session every day this year, however short. I will be moving on after this to last years 30 days as it kicked my butt last year and I want to try again, but after that I will wing it I suppose. I just wanted to say thankyou so much to Adrienne and the team for allowing us these incredible videos, I will forever be greatful to you and the community you have here ❤❤❤❤❤",Sammy K,2021-01-31T09:25:31Z,0

"Thank you! It has been a great 30 days! I loved this last practice too, but as I usually mainly listen to your voice, Adriene, I found it difficult to both do my own thing and let myself be inspired by your sequence. I would love to return to this sequence often and I am wondering if it would be possible to have optional minimal cues recorded voice-over with the music? Just &quot;chataranga to three legged dog, to warrior one, warrior two, triangle pose&quot; sort of thing. But maybe it isn&#39;t technically possible - or &quot;yogically&quot; desirable?",Sara Krueger,2021-01-31T09:17:45Z,1

Today I was feeling a bit nervous about ‘what next?’ and your email with the February calendar arrived right then!

"Every ending is indeed a new beginning. For me, BREATH has been a transition in difficult and happy moments at the same time. I finally decided to go back home for good last Christmas, after 9 years working in different places and struggling to just see my family from time to time. During January I had to get used to be back in a small town, away from all the friends from the last years, close to my family, but without the chance to be with them as much as I wanted to. It&#39;s been quite an unstable period but Adriene, Benji and all this beautiful community has helped me to stop, BREATH, connect, focus and start again. Thank all of you for making everyday unique and full of gratitude. This will be indeed a new start for me, having yoga as my companion for good and bad days. I do really hope to see (and read) some of you around for the next months in YWA or FWFG. <br /><br />Wish you all the best, Namaste.",Angela Santonja Climent,2021-01-31T09:05:39Z,0

Thank you for another wonderful January series.  I have been following you for years and can I again ask that you guide us through the special last practice.

Although we were taking our distances, I surely felt it. The journey was not easy but I managed to end together with all of you. The daily practice is my anchor and Adriene has helped me get through the first difficult days and surely will continue to do so. Thank you so much for all the love and connectedness that you give!

And I am so happy right now, because I did the whole 50 freaking minutes! :D  Thank you Adriene, I found something mine on the mat.

Loved the journey and being with all of you on it. This freestyle one was not for me. Kept looking at the video only to find me wanting each time to do the pose you were in Adriene. Frustrating. Not how I&#39;d hoped to end the journey but being on it was great.,Ken Millard,2021-01-31T08:04:53Z,0
"Adriene, this was so beautiful. <br />It was a commitment I didn&#39;t know I would make when I randomly stepped on the mat four weeks ago. But then I showed up, day after day. It felt less like a challenge but more like a welcome, like a common journey and today it felt like an arrival on the mat. <br />I flowed with my eyes closed for the first 20 minutes, my arms wanted to dance so I let them dance through the poses and movements. I sought your guidance when I needed it and when we came together for the final Namasté, I had tears running from my eyes because there was a huge wave of gratitude rushing over me. I felt this deep in my heart. <br />Thank you for introducing me to Yoga, Adriene. I will continue to join you on the mat. ❤️",lina.pascale,2021-01-31T08:03:54Z,1

"Every time I get to day 30 I feel frustrated! I Don’t really understand why she’s not talking as usual and how we are supposed to do the flow this way!<br />It’ s like you get the flours, make the dough, bake the cake, slice the cake... and when you are there with the fork ready to finally eat it and enjoy you great work, they steal it from you!!!<br /> Why? Why? Pleas Adriene talk through the flow! If someone wants to make it just with music, they can put it sound off and choose another music! This is so frustrating! Every year, every time, I end up frustrated and sad. <br />Please think about this. <br />Thanks",Francesca Bettoni,2021-01-31T07:53:00Z,0

"I spent much of today&#39;s practice in tears. This month has in some ways been the hardest of the pandemic thus far, and one of things that got me through was this journey, knowing that at 1AM every night a new video would be waiting for me.

"What a bittersweet feeling, this end and new beginning. It was such an honor to do yoga with all of you for 30 days! Can you believe it? This was my first „freestyle“ practice and I felt a bit lost at some points, but always had Adriene to look to whenever I got stuck. No rush, just finding inspiration and sometimes even finding myself in the same pose as her when I looked over. <br />It was definitely an experience even though for the time being I still enjoy the guided practices more. But this one was important too. <br />Love to you all &lt;3",dazzzlingworld,2021-01-31T07:40:27Z,0

"I am 22 years old and this is my 8th year practicing yoga and my 4th year doing it with you Adriene, you don&#39;t know how much you have helped me through my journey of discovering my authentic self. <br /><br />Every year I get more and more excited about our 30 Day Journey as a community and every day I see myself getting better. I am not referring to the poses (though I have improved physically so, so much) but I am referring to the mindset.  <br /><br />Especially with &#39;Breath&#39;, I have realized that finally, I have stopped trying to figure out the poses and my body, but I started to observe, to feel, and to get involved with the practice in a higher sense. It really is hard to describe, yet you have been explaining it perfectly, everyday bit by bit. <br /><br />Therefore,  I want to say thank you, you have no idea how much this journey&#39;s meant to us in such a crazy time like this, where everything is changing drastically every second...<br /><br />And, I promise myself that when things get tough I WILL return to my breath and I will send you a silent &#39;Namaste&#39;!..<br /><br /><br />&lt;3",Defne N,2021-01-31T07:37:03Z,1

"Wow, what a journey. I can’t believe it’s over already! I wasn’t sure I’d make it through this full final practice but I just kept coming back to my breath and I did it and loved it. I’ve never been great at the breathing part of yoga and always been quite disconnected and blasé about my breath, but this journey has really helped me learn its importance and how useful it is as a guide and an integral foundation of my yoga practice (but also my day to day life).

"I’m so relieved I’m not the only one who feels this way. My first 30-day program was True in 2017. I absolutely loved every single day of it but when I got to day 30 I felt like someone pulled the rug out from under me. I felt abandoned. Every year since I’ve hoped day 30 would be different. I’ve been practicing yoga for years, but when left on my own I feel awkward and can’t seem to string together poses in a cohesive flow. Adriene’s voice is my anchor. I loved Breath, but today I did Day 28, which I missed on Friday.",JoAnn Knox,2021-01-31T13:59:37Z,3

"I&#39;m the same. But what I&#39;ve started doing is watching the video first and using the voice recorder app on my phone to record my own cues. Then I do the video, using my own recorded audio cues. It&#39;s not perfect, but it does cut down on neck strain from trying to look up at the video all the time to see what&#39;s going on.",Joanne McNair,2021-01-31T13:02:59Z,3

"As we come to the mat on this, our final day of this wonderful 30 day journey, I wanted to share my own experience, with gratitude to Adriene and with kindness and best wishes to all my fellow yogis. This journey has helped me to replace the indulgence of the festive season with an overwhelming clarity of what is important and how I want to spend my time; self care and self love with dedication to my health and my practice. The regular sitting with my breath has become a part of me and I part of it, and for this opportunity we have Adriene to thank. I feel stronger, more flexible and more focused than ever before. They say that you only get out of something what you put in to it, and with the joyful guidance through this journey it has been a pleasure to put the effort it and I can’t wait to return each day. So much so that I’ve signed up to Find What Feels Good and intend to make this the start of a beautiful way of living, I can highly recommend this journey to you and I wish you all well wherever you are on your own life’s journey.

Congratulations Adriene for making this happen, and to everyone who embarked on this beautiful journey. To practice live with thousands of people everyday has been an inexplicable experience, I feel as though I&#39;ve made so many friends and companions simply by recognising names in the comments day-to-day. This unity has kept me grounded, and my breath practice has brought me closer to something internally that I have never felt before. If you are reading this, I love you.

Can’t believe! I actually did yoga FOR 30 BIG DAYS! It feels so surreal to reach so far! Never thought I would be here feeling so proud at myself for going along this journey! My heart is so full knowing that this is going to be the last day of this journey! This month went by so peaceful! My mind has become so calm! All this month was full of positivity and love! ALL THANKS TO YOU ADRIENE!🤍,Kashish Kumari,2021-01-31T06:03:06Z,35

"@Damiensca Bishop it’s really good to read your experience and see how far we’ve come. 🙏🏼✨ february, here we come!",MB Harmony,2021-02-01T18:13:52Z,0
@MB Harmony Great! It was amazing wasn’t it! This is the 4th 30 day yoga with Adrien journey I have done and they always end with this freestyle. I am amazed by how much more confident and connected I was this time than the first time and how much more I can include. One of the best things Adrien has given me is the ability to create my own practices! Keep knocking on heaven’s door! 💛💕🌻🥰,Damiensca Bishop,2021-02-01T08:32:44Z,1
@Damiensca Bishop so yeah it went like 1 hour of Knocking On Heaven’s Door xD but for real my body just went with what i needed and it was one of the best experiences i’ve had. 100/10 would recommend. 👌🏼✨🙏🏼💙,MB Harmony,2021-02-01T06:31:24Z,1
Yes! Freestyle and with love! How did it go? 💜🌻💕,Damiensca Bishop,2021-01-31T11:10:36Z,2

"Before I begin this practice, I want to say thank you for this. Me and my mother are honoured to continue these 30 Day Yoga Journeys with you. You have blessed us both, and we can&#39;t appreciate you enough for it. Thank you, Adrian. Namaste",Bendy,2021-01-31T06:01:26Z,30
"Wow. That felt so good. Thank you Adriene &lt;3 I got so into it, that I even went &quot;overtime&quot;, wasn&#39;t quite done with all the cooling down when the music stopped ^^ another beautiful journey over - another one just about to begin :) seriously, you have made my life so much better, ever since I found you when I just searched for &quot;yoga&quot; on Youtube - then it was motivated by it being so slippery outside that I couldn&#39;t go for a run; now I prefer yoga to running :)<br />(Did this on the membership earlier, that&#39;s how I&#39;m already done - wishing you all a lot of fun and good times doing it here on Youtube, and sending much love and compassion &lt;3)",M Chagawa,2021-01-31T06:01:26Z,12

"Adriene (and Benji🐾) — I want to thank you so much for these yearly live journeys you provide for all of us. It truly starts my year off right and this year it was needed more than ever!! <br />Every time I come to the mat I find myself more-it’s because of you and these practices that have allowed me to do so, allowed me to slow down, allowed me to love myself just as I am and allowed me to be proud of myself for just showing up. <br />You’re a true blessing to so many and I only wish you all the best throughout the rest of this year. <br />I’ll keep showing up daily with all the wonderful practices you have available for us. Thank you again, Adriene.  “Breath” was beautiful!❤️💕❤️💕",Holly,2021-01-31T06:00:18Z,115
