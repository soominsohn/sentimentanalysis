This session is not a fix all but I think it does a damn good job of gently putting you in an empowered role to center in your awareness and guide yourself forward. <br />Because no one else can do that for you. <br />No guru. It has to be you.<br /><br />How are you feeling after today&#39;s practice?,Yoga With Adriene,2021-03-07T14:03:03Z,1056

We are all vaccinated and today was our last virtual yoga session, and I felt this video was very fitting for today:) Virtual workouts weren’t as great as in person... but doing yoga with you and my friends was wonderful and I’m gonna miss it (although I’m still going to do it on my own... or at least try!) thanks for everything:)",Tara Summerville,2021-05-04T20:13:00Z,0

Did absolutely nothing besides watching Netflix I felt so tired. And then today I decided to clean the house and finally do some yoga again. And then I got to doing this video, which was absolutely perfect. And at the end I chose to make these coming six weeks my bitch! I&#39;m gonna graduate and I can do it!!",Anke,2021-04-18T11:57:52Z,0

"I have been following her channel for almost 7 years now but all these years I have been introduced to some really amazing yoga videos and now when I got back to her channel I feel she talks more and gets less done. She is so busy talking that she forgets that we are in a pose here waiting. She talks so much that she forgets right side left side. She has her own terminology which is not yoga asana names at all which can confuse audience who are looking for serious yoga. Here references to creaky old floor, peanut butter, movies and songs are never ending. Her videos are more and more falling to a level of chatting talking and doing some asanas in between. She is good if you are looking for entertainment. Cat meffan, yoga lates with Rashmi and breathe and flow are such amazing channels with serious yoga. Crisp and to the point. After having following her channel for so long I think I am super disappointed and Definitely will not watch her videos.",shradhajatkar,2021-04-11T05:07:33Z,0

I normally do my yoga in the morning and I just didn’t today I didn’t start this till 715 tonight and when I saw it was 46 minutes I thought I’ll never make it and then I couldn’t believe it I was down to the last four minutes and she says don’t quit now I’m like heck no I’m not quitting now 😄.

"This was so nourishing. I spent all day shoveling , mulching, wheelbarrowing and so part of me was just wanting to go lay starfish on a cool floor but I showed up anyway and I’m so happy I did. I felt like this was catered to me (always feeling this), like how did she know my back and bones were so achy. Because I was already so worked over by the garden I felt acutely aware of every muscle during this one, normally that isn’t the case, but sheesh!! I felt my way through every pose in the best possible way. 🙏",Brianna Byers,2021-04-11T02:32:40Z,0

I began to sway before you said it, felt &#39;&#39; knocking on heaven&#39;s door&#39;&#39; arriving and deeply listened to those final words. I began the practice anxious with tears threatening to flow at any time, I ended up flowing with an incredible positive energy. I don&#39;t know if any of this makes any sense, cause it&#39;s nearly 1am and English is not my first language.. but hey, I mean every word. Namaste",Hind LEKAM,2021-04-10T23:44:31Z,0

I’ve never been good at sticking with things so I am incredibly proud of making it this far and my fresh start is committing to the next 100 days of yoga! I’m amazed at the changes I’ve seen in myself, both physically and mentally; I’m happier when I look in the mirror than I have been in a long time (I’ve actually got muscle definition and a little booty starting!!) and the improvements to my mental health are even more astonishing considering the times we live in.

"Well, felt like leaving my first ever comment under a video. Hi, hello, hope y’all having a great day :) <br /><br />Today&#39;s practice felt really special for some reason. Even yesterday I was looking at the 46 minute timer and felt a bit scared, cause I think that&#39;s the longest video in a while for me (I have successfully missed it last month). But I really tried to think about doing it since the evening  to work up the motivation and, to my surprise, I managed. And it felt very nice and liberating in the end! Especially when somewhere in the middle of our dance I realised that, despite not being anywhere as consistent with my practice as a lot of you, I felt stronger in my moves. <br /><br />Yesterday was hard for me mentally. The project I’ve been working on for almost 2 months got taken down due ‘not being as useful as was originally expected’ (despite the fact that I kept on saying how it might not be what managers expect, no one listened to just an intern). My mom was in my ass about not calling auntie to wish her Happy Birthday, but just sending a message, cause she keeps on thinking that sending a message = not caring. For some reason these things really bugged me, so starting my day with this sequence really felt like a Fresh Start. <br /><br />Ever since a few years ago, after I broke my arm, I never managed to go back to any form of activity consistently. I tried multiple times and would always stop cause I felt like if I missed a few days - there was no point in doing it altogether. But ever since finding Adriene again after so many years (I used to do her videos before breaking my arm to support my always-in-pain low back), I decided to approach it differently and not bully myself for skipping a few days or even a week. So I may not be all that impressive, but showing up for a practice 14 times last month was an accomplishment already. <br /><br />Trying to continue this month and got 8/10 in April so far! And to celebrate, I’m gonna gonna and make myself very yummy sandwich for breakfast/lunch. <br />Hope whoever reads has a great weekend! Have fun and RENEW :)",Nika Weller,2021-04-10T14:46:01Z,4

"It sounds like you&#39;re in a tough place, please speak to your doctor. It&#39;s important to have a medical ally to help you with alcohol issues. They can work with you to decrease your drinking and to deal with your anxiety. Alcohol is a depressant and anti-anxiety, but it reduces serotonin, so when the alcohol wears off you just feel more anxious. People drink more and more and their anxiety gets worse and worse. It can destroy your life. Getting help to treat your anxiety and to cut back your alcohol use will have you in a better place. Yoga can be a tool to help, but having a medical professional on your side through this, helping you set out a plan, is an important tool as well. Take care",Prosateuse,2021-04-10T23:03:57Z,0

"Favorite ironic moment with Adriene (214th consecutive day of YWA&amp;B):  1st place “Let’s start in a comfortable seat.”  Because of a lifetime of muscle stiffness, joint inflexibility and lousy posture, virtually no seated position involving crossed legs, a vertical spine or any other pose involving good posture is “comfortable” for me.  All attempts to approximate them are all very active (uncomfortable) poses, involving intentional muscle action, often with shaking, heavy breathing, etc.  They are helpful in many ways but nonetheless make me grimace and giggle every single time.  First runner up: “We’re in this for 5, 4,...”. In real life - “push up to a full plank (takes 3 seconds), lengthen your spine, let your front body come up to reach your back body (7 seconds), focus on lengthening your spine (4 seconds), you can do this, you got this, we’re in this for 5, 4, (8 seconds), hang in there (3 seconds), 3, 2, 1 (3 seconds), release everything down to the floor (1 really short second).  Total time for a 5 second plank - 29 seconds.",Mark Whittier,2021-03-30T15:45:41Z,0

I have a question: when we do downwards facing dog or all fours my right wrist feels more stiff than the left because it has slight repetitive strain injury from writing and using my laptop etc. Its not painful but sometimes it feels a bit awkward. Any suggestions to ensure more comfort and also to prevent repetitive strain injury? As a singer I often have to play piano for learning pieces to but of course there is always admin and promotion to do so want to get to the bottom of how to take care of my wrist. It has been the case for at least three years due to studying too. Really appreciate any suggestions - thank you and have a lovely day😃☺☀️,Natalka Pasicznyk,2021-03-28T13:20:15Z,1

"I feel completely recentered after each practice. The mindfulness and posture work has helped elevate my life off the mat. Most of my chronic back pain has gone away recently, and I know it&#39;s because I have awareness in my spine. I also find myself more at peace energy-wise throughout the day. Much like during these sessions, I can use the breath to carry me through challenging moments when I want to give up or recede. With your guidance I have grown more confident and strong, inside and out. Much love &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",Kaitlyn Glavor,2021-03-22T18:23:17Z,1

"SHLM &amp; HaB (peace &amp; love).  The Name of the Creator is Hayah asher Hayah, as what He told Mose (Exodus 3:14), preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures.  There is a curse to the G-o-d name (Isaiah 65:11-12), preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures.  All followers of the Messiah are to do the 7 appointed times (Leviticus 23), but no more animal sacrifices, following the Crucifixion of the Messiah.  We are now of the order of MLK TSDQ (King, righteous), to Whom ABRaHM tithed.  Ask the Messiah to be your personal Savior.  He is the Atoning Offering for mankind for the remission of sin ( 1 John 2:1-2).  He said to him, I am the way, the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me (John 14:6).  If you believe the Messiah died on the cross, &amp; Resurrected three days later (presenting Himself as First Fruits to the Father), please ask Him to be your Savior.  He is the ONLY way to Everlasting Life.  Yoga allows demons to enter the temple/body.  Ask the Creator to help you not do this matter.",Gina Rios,2021-03-17T01:33:07Z,0

"Adriene, thank you so much for your incredible, gentle, and caring work!<br />I&#39;m only starting my way in yoga, but I already see how stressed and tense I am. Most of the basic movements are so hard for me, that sometimes I burst into tears.<br /><br />I want to take my time and go slow, and I would really like to follow step-by-step practice by B. K. S. Iyengar. In his book &quot;Light on Yoga: Yoga Dipika&quot;, there is a plan divided into 1-2 weeks periods for total starters. In this period you&#39;re supposed to learn few asanas, get used to them and then add a new one.<br /><br />Is there any way to ask you to make 1 video for each of those weeks for the first, basic level?<br />I would absolutely buy them as a product, and having you showing the practice would help me so much!<br /><br />If somebody reading this comment knows about such videos - please, share a link, I&#39;ll be very grateful!",Полина Шипунова,2021-03-13T21:16:29Z,0

"I&#39;m not going to lie, I started this and got to the 27-minute mark before I got super frustrated and wanted to cry because I felt like I couldn&#39;t do those movements and I think that because I&#39;m already a bit emotionally overwhelmed that I was genuinely upset about that, enough to &quot;give up&quot; for a while if you will. I had to pause the video and drink my tea for a few minutes to settle down and remind myself that new things are hard, that THIS was hard, but that&#39;s ok. <br /><br />I&#39;m going to try that part again, but this time with the knowledge that I will get better and this is the fresh start and simply a baseline for what&#39;s to come. <br /><br />Deep breaths. I can do this.",Kyla Kersh,2021-03-13T18:51:10Z,7

I love Adriene&#39;s message about taking time for yourself and it&#39;s so true that just showing up is the hardest part. Now that yoga is here for me everyday I feel much more connected with myself and no longer feel guilty that I&#39;m giving up something else to do this. This channel has been a large part of my journey to change how I approach the daily practice. Your message is right on point for me. Thanks so much!,Chaitra,2021-03-12T11:39:00Z,0

"Adriene,.....what would have led you to seeking adidas as a sponsor? I feel sad to see that you have combined yogic teachings with what seems a self seeking plan for you to make money through unethical means. While Adidas has shown that it is making progress in terms of sustainability and labour rights, at the end of the day the brand is still very much a part of the fast fashion industry. Producing huge quantities of garments (most of which are not made from sustainable materials) has disastrous effects not only on the environment, but also on workers who often have to work long hours for very little pay in order to reach production targets.",Amelia Swan,2021-03-10T09:21:30Z,0

I confess I usually shy away from over 30 minutes, but after a lazy weekend I wanted to do a bit more, so the timing was right. I realise how far I have come with my practice, because I felt comfortable throughout, whilst still challenging myself. (Ok well chair and Eagle are still hard 😳) The whole practice felt like a meditation, slow and mindful, and by the end I felt both relaxed and energised.

"Unbelievable! Exactly the theme I needed, released on the exact day I was ready for it. The stillness at the beginning felt SO right, the neck stretches were exactly the ones I&#39;d been doing all day, and then right when we finished that last twist and were stretching out, I thought, &quot;Ooh, knocking on heaven&#39;s door would feel really good, maybe I&#39;ll do that when the video&#39;s over&quot; ... and then BAM. I have been in a very &quot;serious place&quot; for the last two weeks, just starting to crawl out of it, and I finish this feeling so still and centered and <b>good.</b> Thank you!",otempora16,2021-03-08T01:27:07Z,0

And then I stood there crying wanting to put those aggressive thoughts against myself and the world into movement . And you, Adriene, said that we would now do knocking on heaven&#39;s door.

"Just did this practice and loved it, really loving my daily yoga practice with Adriene, it’s day 77 today of doing yoga with YWA since Dec 20, 2020, following the Feb calendar and now March after doing the January BREATH journey, I am so much the better for this daily practice. It’s my safe haven , my time of peace and contentment and movement and my connection to my mind and body and heart through the power of BREATH. ❤️",Tasneem Siahiwala,2021-03-07T15:02:27Z,0

"I have to admit I felt disappointed when I saw today&#39;s video. It&#39;s new so I thought today was going to be my all time favourite, Yoga for Strength. I had been looking forward to it all day yesterday. But I pushed through, and honestly did not connect as well as I would have liked. But I am so glad I persevered because learning to show up for myself, even when it&#39;s hard (for any reason) is the best lesson I have learned from Adriene. And I can&#39;t wait for all the new people from Breath to experience tomorrow&#39;s video!",lyadmilo,2021-03-07T14:57:06Z,0
"Thank you so much for this practice, Adriane! I wasn&#39;t feeling myself lately, and I haven&#39;t done any yoga for the past 3+ months because I was feeling suffocated with deadlines and anxiety. However, today I felt like I can go out of this dark place I am in for a while and searched for your channel and, this almost like perfectly meant for me title popped out. I feel so proud of myself for doing the whole practice, and I hope I find the power to come back to my mat again because nothing makes me feel better than doing yoga with you.",42istheanswer,2021-03-07T14:55:47Z,0

"Dear Adriene, you&#39;re always so timely! Have been going through a rough couple of months since catching Covid in December. Breathe in Jan was my commitment and motivation to slowly getting back in shape until I started to get a pain in my leg which has been an unwanted companion for almost two months now. Have been feeling frustrated, angry and very anxious lately. Luckily, I&#39;ve a great support system at home and pep talk has been helping me trying to focus on the positives, little progresses I make every day while I try to recover from my leg pain. I&#39;ve embraced this practice and supported myself with blocks (which I never needed before covid!), accepting that sometimes you just need that extra help.  I&#39;m grateful to be part of your lovely, welcoming and supportive community. ❤️🥰 Muchas gracias por ser tan maravillosa",Deborah Peñate Gómez,2021-03-07T14:35:33Z,0

"One of the best practice I have ever done. I really didn’t want to do it because of the time but I’m so happy that I did it. Since I started my ED recovery, it’s hard to not go back. Accepting change is hard and this definitely helped. I’m also dealing with the change of my future plans and this made me realize that it’s totally fine to change your plans about going to Uni and that you should look forward instead of looking back.",Aira,2021-03-07T10:00:54Z,0

"I waited so patiently for this new video today. It dropped at 11:30 AM IST here, and I joined in right away. <br />Thanks so much for this video, Adriene❤️ For the first time, it was the intention that was hard. I didn&#39;t know how to complete the sentence. So I decided, moving forward, I choose, to move forward. With time maybe, I&#39;ll land on the specifics. <br />This was the practice I didn&#39;t know I needed. Thanks so much. Love ❤️❤️",Sriprada N S,2021-03-07T07:02:38Z,0
