"It’s so important that we take the time to check in with ourselves, especially when our relationship to the future brings a certain kind of weariness.<br /><br />How are you feeling after today&#39;s full length practice?",Yoga With Adriene,2021-02-07T14:34:59Z,764
"Thank you so much for this practice. I had been out of touch with my relationship with yoga for months and just picked it up today after getting engaged 2 days ago. While this is wonderful and exciting, there are many other emotions that im feeling as well (among them uncertainty for the future). This is just what I needed for that emotional release. ❤",Mary Schabilion,2021-05-09T02:14:19Z,0

Without a qualified instructor you cannot receive the benefits.  Adrienne is unqualified to bestow any usable benefits so she is a waste of time,walter cabey,2021-04-29T16:36:14Z,1
"I hadn&#39;t been able to do this practice because I couldn&#39;t find the energy for 50 minutes of yoga. But I did it right after I got the answer I have been waiting for for over a year. I was shaking throughout most of it, like a dog releasing tension. I feel a lot better now.<br />I so so so appreciate this practice. The detailed instructions helped me find so many new nuances today it&#39;s crazy. <br />So if you&#39;re reading this and need some encouragement: please try it if you can! I know it helped me feel better a lot.",Lian Beijers,2021-04-28T05:42:00Z,0

Adrienne... I have so enjoyed practicing Yoga with you every morning since shortly after the Pandemic began. I began on Prime and noticed lots of the practices I saved are no longer available. I don&#39;t have a lot of time in the mornings during my work week and hope you will continue offering practices there. This practice was LOVELY and offered so much for me. Grateful for your gentle approach and direction. Your humor is delightful and quiets any thoughts of self criticism. ♥️,A Adams,2021-04-25T12:31:29Z,0

"I used to do yoga twice a day. Morning and night, I made such good progress. I got sick at the start of the pandemic and it took a toll on my body, and I stopped yoga. I already have Fibromyalgia and hypermobility and I lost all motivation to do yoga. I have recently started to do the odd day of yoga and im really trying to do it every day after work. I&#39;m so exhausted from work that I don&#39;t think I can even find the motivation to get my mat. This practice is my first long practice. I didn&#39;t even notice how long this practice was, I just did it with no hesitation. I&#39;ve had migraines for the past week coming from my awful back and shoulder pain. I feel so much better after this practice. I feel like my muscles are stronger and looser. Most importantly I feel proud of myself for finally rolling out the mat again. I missed yoga so much. 🧘‍♂️",SimplySaz,2021-04-20T20:34:30Z,0
"I like these long videos, though I&#39;m in bad shape so we&#39;ll see how well it goes. <br /><br />If I could do a request from you, I find that prolonged but light exercise does me the most good, so if we could get a few videos that last for an hour but don&#39;t demand too much constant muscle strength, that would be amazing.<br /><br />A big thank you to you from Finland, from a follower of yours for almost since you started making videos on Youtube.",Lawrence H,2021-04-20T19:12:29Z,0

"I’ve been doing yoga with adriene for a couple of years and last night doing this video was the first time I fully understood “anchor in the details.” I felt completely in my body, tuned into each movement like I’ve never been before. I saw my breath as my friend and felt how uniquely each of my muscles move. It was a relief for someone who lives most of their life in their thoughts. I am constantly learning I am not my thoughts and emotions but the awareness behind them.",Rylie Tibbatts,2021-04-18T15:48:45Z,0

I have broken down, tears of relief and release. You touch on so much more than the physical, you elevate my mindset, bring peace in my world for those few minutes on the mat and most of all I feel secure and can let go of control and trust you completely to help me nurture my body and soul.

As a recent grad, I&#39;m having a tough time finding a full-time job, I&#39;m dealing with toxicity at home, and due to the travel ban, I can&#39;t visit my boyfriend.

"Hi Adriene! I LOVE your videos and so does my friend.  Although my best friend, who is an Indian American, had a interesting discussion with me about the importance of yoga teachers making it clear where the tradition of yoga came from, and also making a special point to use more of the original names for the poses. Yoga can be for anyone! but since yoga has become more mainstream, as you can imagine, it could be irritating for this cultural practice to become totally disconnected from its creators. I don&#39;t think for the most part you partake in this but there&#39;s definitely a lot of white people (even some in your audience) who are openly disrespectful towards Indian people (I see it all the time: at school, in public, and family events) and then brag about how they do yoga, totally ignorant to the fact that they&#39;re practicing something created by those same people. I truly mean no disrespect and I love your stuff Adriene, just food for thought.","Kisses, Dani",2021-03-06T19:01:46Z,0

"IMPORTANT FOR ADRIENE TO SEE: I had a great inspiration today while working out and wanted to share with you as something to maybe try in one of videos. A video like this would be outside of your the typical flow of your 30 days journeys and more focused on having a very meditative experience. The main idea is what I was call a Yoga Breath Series - that instead of narrating while posing if you just used a head worn mic just to capture your inhales and exhales as you moved through poses and then you overlayed the narration afterwards. This way the student can really focus on their body-breath-mind connection while moving through each pose. I think this is a central part of the yoga experience but is something that you usually only can do once you&#39;ve developed and memorized a practice but is hard to create during instruction because the instructor is having to narrate and guide during the poses. This would be different from the usual home practice vibe of your videos, but I think a few videos like this might catch on for those looking to really engage into an unfamiliar practice. I wanted to share this feedback cause I love your channel and how much great content you give away for free and hope the idea could contribute in some way to the success of these videos or maybe something you could share with a fellow content creator. Thanks Adriene! Like up if the concept interests you.",nicolasap86,2021-03-02T16:53:19Z,0

"I just finished Breath which was my first 30-day challenge and I absolutely loved it! Is there anywhere I can get the shirt you’re wearing in this video? Breath feels so special to me being my first challenge, and it taught me so many new things and helped me connect to myself so much! I would love to have a physical reminder of that :)",Rachel Flora,2021-02-24T20:20:56Z,0

"Just what I needed. You are a great teacher, I enjoy your classes because you are grounded. If people are looking for something more athletic or acrobatic, there are thousands of other teachers. I think in these times of uncertainty it is perhaps hardest to slow down and reconnect with your breath. Being patient with uncertainty in our lives and being ok with not knowing is very challenging.

"So, I&#39;m an intermediate yogi and I tried this one.  At first I was impatient, saying to Adriene &quot;Come on already.&quot; But then I noticed a shift in me. That I had to really focus on each posture, breathe into it.  And when Adriene said that those who are asking for a more advanced practice,  that the practice as advanced, and we were forced to deeply breathe and stay with each posture for more than a second. I started to shift.  Each posture was deliberate. Each posture was not rushed. And it was challenging. So bravo Adrienne, for doing this one.  I loved it. Thank you.",Elaine K,2021-02-21T22:23:22Z,0

"Hi Adriene, <br />First I want to say thank you so much for making these videos. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga following along with your videos for the last 3 months and it&#39;s truly been such a positive and transformative experience. <br /><br />I know that this is out of left field and not at all the focus of this page, but I was wondering if you would ever consider making a video that&#39;s yoga for trans folks or yoga for pre top surgery. Maybe for June/pride month?  I started my yoga journey on your page because I&#39;ve been preparing for top surgery and I need to increase my upper body strength as well as mobility and stability in my neck and shoulders and upper back. Your videos have been so wonderful for that. <br /><br />Again I know that&#39;s not the focus of your page, but I think it fits really well into the spirit of your page, which I see as self care, self actualization, connecting with your body and mind. <br /><br />Thank you again for such wonderful resources.",Kate Roll,2021-02-19T20:05:45Z,0

Your voice is so calming and I love your personality so much, it makes me look forward to yoga time! I do have a question though: for some reason, whenever I attempt sukhasana my thighs start trembling and my back really hurts. Is it okay to substitute it with seiza/virasana? People say it&#39;s more painful than sukhasana but honestly, for me it&#39;s actually the opposite. Thank you in advance and lots of love from Italy ❤️",Rachele Pescio,2021-02-14T18:08:48Z,0

{ㄅㄆㄇㄈㄉㄊ}.治療疾病或傷口必須先消炎.緩解症狀後.才能準確找到患處和傷口.若在發炎狀態.使用殺病毒的毒素.可能會致死.因為身體一個部位發炎.會感染多個神經系統.造成多部位疼痛.尤其是長期看電視.電腦.手機.造成的眼睛發炎.常會感染腦神經及牙齦神經.發病速度快.致死率高.若等到發燒時.發炎狀態肯定相當嚴重.若沒迅速消炎.減輕身體器官運作的負擔.誤診開錯刀.恐會毀了一生.曾經被蜜蜂及蚊蟲叮咬過.所以我極端排斥注射或吸取的針頭..麻黃樹是易燃材質.常添加於藥劑作擴展滲透用途.但主成分還是以消炎藥為療劑.而添加擴展滲透的麻黃樹成分.常運用在急性發炎.也就是說沒有麻黃樹的擴展滲透成分.消炎藥一樣有效.但是效果較為緩和.當身體急速老化.經常是過度疲勞奔波.身體內部有發炎症狀.消炎後老化狀況就會改善.{理論上使用消炎感冒藥.就有延緩老化的效能}.而當吃消炎藥後.身體消炎後.可能須等下次發炎.再吃才有療癒的感覺.有藥品消費者訴說.藥品包裝使用說明是整袋滿滿.可是解開後.卻半包不到.是不是藥品包裝有缺口.漏掉了???常有人將垃圾稱為病.將有毒的垃圾稱為病毒.而微小菌體只是將生物關在密閉空間.生物死亡後不斷分解成為微小菌體.直至穿過密閉空間.許多人都知道將垃圾掩埋後會產生瓦斯沼氣.而有毒的垃圾掩埋物.就會產生毒氣.雖然戴口罩.還是會讓人產生種種不適.曾發生過瘟疫.後來將垃圾焚燒後.疫情才慢慢減緩.在電視廣告有一種日本東京大正製藥.上面有鷹的標誌的黃色粉狀感冒藥.相當有效.因做生意常要騎車到處去又常喝冰飲.有天頭痛.我吃一包後.隔天就好了.才知道頭痛是扁桃腺發炎造成.消炎後後頭痛.肌肉緊繃的狀況就好了.但須注意有效的藥物..常被仿冒商標或高價賣給不知何處購買的人.有個故事.在國際上有感冒藥廠的商標是一隻鷹.而感冒藥劑研發.是為了救一隻落海失溫的鷹.由於藥劑很有效賣得很好.註冊商標後.有人將鷹寫成英.該藥廠為怕引來陌名的麻煩及利益紛爭.在特定區域將該藥列為違禁藥品..微量的汽油能治療許多疾病.{外部傷病很有效.但身體內部有微血管神經.需注意}但是汽油就像熱開水.須加點緩衝質.來降溫.才不會對人體造成傷害..有個問題.為什麼.國營事業的盈利是軍公教加薪分紅.而國營事業的虧損.卻要國家居民支出.難道只有軍公教才是國民嗎?能解釋國營和民營的意思嗎??醫生積極參與政治選舉.是不是因為亂埋醫療廢棄物.被開罰單呢?購買槍械需要考槍械執照嗎?考槍械執照有分級數嗎?美國的槍械執照在中華民國臺灣有效嗎?,郭仲哲,2021-02-13T04:26:00Z,0

"Held off on this practice until I had a good chunk of time for it. May need to repeat it this evening since,  just after I finished, I discovered the phone line was dead. Not quite ready to cut the landline cord, but will have to do without until we decide it’s worth it to deal with inside-the-house line repair. 😩 Need to shake off the stress of dealing with customer service for hours.",Trish Chalifoux,2021-02-12T18:57:17Z,0
"Oh wow... I did this beautiful practise after a long day, feeling tired and cranky. Found myself super energetic and happy afterwards and was once again surprised by the power of Yoga. Thank you Adriene!",instarieke,2021-02-12T18:31:11Z,0
"I started doing yoga and yoga with Adriene (simultaneously) in March when Covid caused us to stay in our homes. This particular practice has been absolutely one of my favorites. Not only did I find it challenging, I found it spiritual.I came away from this practice feeling wonderful, as if my senses were awoken and closer to my own heart. Thank You Adriene.",Laura Rubin,2021-02-12T18:17:44Z,0

"It always annoys me (in the most loving sisterly way) when Adriene puts on that &#39;sympathy&#39; act -- knowing that she&#39;s an actor and all :P. NOT SAYING IT&#39;S FAKE -- perhaps over exaggerated because she knows how difficult it is to communicate how you feel, sometimes. To me, I just feel like...Don&#39;t look at me that way, girl, straighten out those eyebrows! Pity killed God! (jk -- thus spake Zarathustra...)",ForeverLoveItLoud,2021-02-12T15:14:14Z,0

"They don&#39;t give a battery replacement and trying to convince people that we are just protecting the environment. The more problem in environment is the increasing number of dump mobile phones because the phone has poor battery life and the batteries are not easy to replace.

"Hi Adrienne, my name is Terrance I don’t know if you read these comments or not but I just have to say. I’ve been watching your yoga channel for quite some time now but I took a break. Life started becoming overwhelming but because of some of the lessons I’ve learned from the sessions I’ve done I’ve strengthened my mind on a complete different level. Today I told myself I was going to do yoga and the very first one I saw was dealing with uncertainty. You are an absolute genius and I don’t know what forces are working in this universe but I thank you so so so so so much for making this video. Very proud your a fellow Texan too 🙏🏾😁",Terrance Sowell,2021-02-11T01:26:05Z,3

"Dear Adriene, our lives in Myanmar can’t be more uncertain than this month. I love celtic music, table tennis, yoga and watching soccer but it’s been ten days that I couldn’t do any of them. It’s been ten days that I couldn’t do any practice with you. I’ve never missed more than two consecutive days in a year. The military coup stressed us so much that we couldn’t follow our passions anymore. They are always ready to cut us off from the whole world and for blood baths. Yesterday’s blood shed in Nay Pyi Taw within peaceful protest was the proof. So many chosen people’s leaders and innocent civilians activists against this coup are detained in unknown places everyday. I don’t know when my turn will come. Now they are trying to build the great fire wall in the country with the help of Chinese Government. I don’t think i’d be able to practice with you anymore after that. We are needing international awareness and EFFECTIVE HELP more than ever! Sanctions won’t do anything. Millions of people all over the country are still protesting daily, trying so hard to get the world notice our helpless situation by using all possible means; most importantly through Civil Disobedience Movement, then memes cultures, reference on Hong Kong Revolution, media attention and etc. I hope things work out right but we can’t tell our futures anymore. Even I or my friend might get detained by this midnight amidst unlawful military raids. We can’t let a blood bath like 1988 to happen again. These authoritarians will do whatever it takes to get the power and oppressed people mostly with the help Russia and China. It’s been ten days that i(we) couldn’t find what feels good. And I’m not sure we’ll ever get it back again. I just wish the world study more about current Myanmar, the Military and tricky issues strategically created by the military dictators. And please help us get our freedom back; which would end decades long civil wars, aftermaths, and bring true democracy and federalism. I wish this comment is not going to be a farewell, Adriene and my FWFG fellas.<br />All the best! <br />may you be peaceful and may you never have to face cruel things like what the military is doing to its own people.<br /><br />Love from the other side of the world with so many uncertainties,<br />Namaste<br />K.<br /><br />(I dare not to post with my own youtube acc as I don’t know what will happen to us after)",Khin Bat,2021-02-11T01:03:50Z,0

"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I find myself getting frustrated when she stops mid-pose &amp; takes quite a bit of time to explain things.  Ruins the flow for me &amp; I often watch these videos in 1.25 or even 1.5 speed because of it.  This way might be helpful for beginners, but for someone who has been doing it awhile, I just want to go through it.  If she did all videos like Day 30 (but w/ speaking), that would be awesome!",roaming gnome,2021-02-10T19:16:22Z,1

"What kind of wizardry is this? I noted I started doing all of my moves synchronised with breath. I mean, I do it subconsciously and when you tell us to move with breath, I gracefully pay attention how I always do it by my own. The same way I always trust my ground and space and close my eyes even before you say so. This is something incredible. Even at the end, which is a new beginning, I noted I naturally breath slower and deeper than usual. This is the true magic of yoga that rejuvenates me from inside.",Clara Sirius,2021-02-10T16:47:45Z,0

"Adrienne, please don’t take this request the wrong way. I was wondering if you might be able to do a breathing practice done specifically for ones with fibromyalgia that could be done in a hot bath? My muscles are so sore often times it is too hard do do much more than a relaxing breathing practice (maybe some small safe yoga movements) in a hot tub while soaking my muscles. I hope that doesn’t sound strange. 🙏<br />Thank you.",Shylynn Sinclair,2021-02-10T04:06:38Z,0

"LOVE this practice. I&#39;m so grateful that you teach &quot;simple&quot; poses, because I&#39;ve learned how challenging they can be when I am focused on presence, awareness, engaging with my body IN THE MOMENT. Learned a lot of that from you. And just like my breath is an old friend, I believe that so are you, Adriene. Grateful for everything you offer this world. Grateful for what I&#39;ve learned from you so that I can keep on my own journey with self-love/respect/empathy. I breathe it in so I can breathe it out! Much love, and Namaste &lt;3",mstaffor1,2021-02-08T19:13:12Z,0

"I hadn’t time for this practice yesterday, but as a senior yogi who made it through Breath, I felt I owed it to myself and even more to you Adriene for all your loving care to do this full class. I had to really breathe deep through this slow slow workout, building my strength and using my knee-down side planks to do all variations. Yay ! I made it through to that very welcome cool down and savasana, super yummy. Lovely new sequence Adriene, see you tomorrow on the mat 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2021-02-08T08:52:41Z,0

"I did not think i would do this so early and not stop halfway, but I did it all the way through going into child’s pose a bit earlier, i was careful with my body, I unexpectedly needed this tonight, yoga has now become a place I go to when i’m sad, such a huge growth for me, thank you adriene you are changing lives everywhere around the world",cal,2021-02-08T08:21:36Z,0

"I&#39;ve been following Yoga with Adriene for quite some time now, however not as consistent as I would want to be (sometimes I do it everyday for a month, then I don&#39;t do it for 2 months like a hiatus of sorts). But this is the first time that I cried in the middle of a yoga practice especially when she was motivating us by saying that &quot;you can do hard things, even in uncertain times&quot; <br /><br />I hope that anyone who decides to accept the challenge of this practice in any given day (whether it is something that you&#39;ve been doing consistently or something you did randomly) will know that more than physical strength, it takes so much willpower and mental strength to choose to love yourself most especially in uncertain times. <br /><br />Thank you for this, Adriene ✨",Maria Aurea Victoria Panaligan,2021-02-08T08:03:33Z,0

As always the universe brought me the things I need most right when I need them. 💕 This practice truly opened my heart and brought me to a good place. I was laying on my back in savana and my 8 month old australian shepherd came over and cuddled my right arm and licked my right hand. 🥲 This caused me to feel a deep tenderness in my chest for his unconditional love. It was profound and brought me tears of gratitude for this perfect loving dog. Perspective changes everything. ❤️ Thank you from all of my heart Adriene for this experience!

I wanted to thank you Adriene, I’m new on this channel but already owe you so much. ❤️❤️",The Paper Letter Blog,2021-02-07T22:05:17Z,4

"A lovely practice which I’m ashamed to say I only got 10 minutes into, after having knees to chest and the comment “we’re going to drop the knees and on an exhale we’re going to let something go....” my immature, in need of a laugh<br />mind, went straight to the image of farting when my knees dropped and I couldn’t stop laughing at the thought😂.  I hasten to add, I actually didn’t do anything, but the thought alone was so funny. I haven’t laughed so much in a long time.  I’ll try better again tomorrow when I’ve recovered 🤣",Bellabob5,2021-02-07T21:40:06Z,3

"I saw the 50minute duration of the video and just for a tiny second had a mini panic attack and tried to justify not doing the practice since I wasn’t feeling “uncertain at the moment”. Then I can’t tell you all how quickly I willed myself to say “I can do this. I have the time. This will only help me (preventative care). It’s GO TIME!” I’m shocked but so much more PROUD I showed up for myself. I deserved every minute of those 50 to tend to myself, so I can then show up for/tend to others. AMAZING practice.

"I am so thankful that I discovered yoga in general and FWFG in particular. I spent 30 years of my life earning a living through grueling physical labor until I transitioned to a desk job after which I jumped into Crossfit which left me a bit battered and broken. But I still want to stay fit, so I think Yoga is the best option for overall wellness especially considering the  synergy of mind, body and spirit  as well  as the stimulation of the body&#39;s various systems ( circulatory, digestive, endocrine, excretory, the list goes on) endowed in us by God.

Anyone have advice on how to keep a side plank from being complete torture on my hands. I just can&#39;t do it. I can&#39;t understand how other people do it. In my body it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense.,MandaPhenom,2021-02-07T15:11:39Z,1
@Shannon Pitts being on the elbow is somehow worse and hurts even more than just trying the hand. I&#39;m not new to any of this though def not an expert either. My body just doesn&#39;t compute these sideways moves.I&#39;ll certainly keep trying since what do I have to loose from trying.,MandaPhenom,2021-02-07T15:33:14Z,0
"Just meet yourself where you are, and you&#39;ll get stronger and be able to do more 😉 I had to start by doing a side plank from my elbow with my hand on the ground for stability (like an L). As time passed and I continued to do yoga, I got stronger and more stable. When I felt ready, I was able to move up to my hand. I was embracing the shake today LOL, but I did it from my hand. You&#39;ll get there!",Shannon Pitts,2021-02-07T15:24:37Z,1

"Thank you Adriene for this practice. I was a bit reticent given I started with a headache, but Adriene&#39;s manner allows room for us to notice we can still find what feels good even when we do not feel our best! And guess what, that Bunny (posture) took away most of my headache. Some of it tried to come back while on the Bridge but the supine twists apparently finished it because when I sat up to comment, it was no longer there. Took me over an hour as I had to stop about four times for short resting intervals but I did it. I thank our community, especially my Breath to Bridge family. Knowing all of you are out there is wonderful given that I do not have a live class and classmates to practice with these days. You provide great support and encouragement, particularly knowing some of your struggles. Not going to let a headache deprive me of the benefits of yoga.<br /><br />Hope everyone is enjoying this journey. 🙏💜<br /><br />Bridge Day 7! Day 126 in a row.",William B,2021-02-07T14:32:08Z,0

"Excelent practice!!! In time, I found out that what feels good for me are the slow practices because they give me time to actually get comfortable in an uncomfortable posture, they give me time to really follow both my breath and my body and dive deeper into being aware of the link between breath and body. Also, I feel that when I allow myself to slow things down, a new kind of self care emerges from within. Thank you so much! Namaste! 🙏",Cacu Cornelia,2021-02-07T12:55:15Z,0

"Whenever a pose requires pushing into the tops of the feet, it feels like I have no ability to do so. For example in bunny pose today, all my weight went into my head. I tried to modify the pose a bit and to engage muscles to push down into my feet but nothing seems to happen, my feet just go up lol. Does anyone know a way to strengthen whatever muscles I need to do this?  I can&#39;t be the only one! Thanks.",carushka,2021-02-07T10:52:19Z,1

Funny fact I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;ll do yoga today because I was tired and 50 minutes seemed too long. I thought I&#39;d give it a try and finished the practice. I was like &quot;Hm I feel better and it didn&#39;t even feel like 1 hour long&quot; As I was folding my mat I laughed thinking that the practice is called &quot;Yoga for uncertainty&quot; 🤣,Marianne Petridou,2021-02-07T10:47:31Z,0

This was a great practice. My only issue is I find it very uncomfortable on the knees for child&#39;s pose and other ones where I have my weight on my knees. Should I just &#39;cushion&#39; it more? Good practice though as I normally do the 15 min morning one,Ruby Rox,2021-02-07T09:18:24Z,1

"@Nikki F  Hi there! Yeah, I was weak. I fell like 50 times during this practice. It was great. Vulnerability is normal. It doesn’t classify me as ‘weak’. It classifies me as human. The only thing poor here is you saying these hurtful comments. So please stop spreading these negative comments. We are all here to learn, grow and be ourselves. It takes a lot of courage for someone to come out and express a part of themselves to others. And you shouldn’t bring someone else down because of that. If you haven’t got anything nice to say, don’t say it at all. It hurts a lot of people.",Raphah Raysa,2021-02-09T09:44:33Z,1

Can I just say though the recent Breathe new year programme was amazing and has changed forever how I will now do and feel during any yoga practice.

This was the first year I didn&#39;t follow the 30 days. I found myself searching for a longer practice. This was an amazing treat to wake up to. Thank you. I loved all the subtle internal work.  Only other person I&#39;ve heard advocaing it as opposed to the more gymnastic poses has been an Irish instructor Jenny Keane.,Paul Fairbrother,2021-02-07T07:08:28Z,0
Since „Breathe“ I feel a difference in your Yoga Sessions. Like there is more awareness and that helps me to become present more easily. Thank you ❤️ 🌹 And greatings from Germany ☀️,Romy Fabienne,2021-02-07T07:04:21Z,183

"Was that really 51 minutes?? It flew by! <br /><br />After BREATH, I decided to start doing the True 30-day journey, and I&#39;m now 4 or 5 videos into it. I&#39;m glad I paused tonight to do this new video instead - this practice fits well with the themes/poses that the True journey starts off with, and was a perfect interlude.",rachelrossos,2021-02-07T07:00:23Z,169
yey... I decided on continuing with revolution - and became aware of how I miss the breathing-awareness-practice from breath - now I`m doing a breathing meditation in addition to revolution - my morning routine gets better and longer :) &lt;3,monika88535,2021-02-09T07:11:33Z,1
