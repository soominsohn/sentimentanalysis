"The environment of the yoga I choose to teach and share is one that doesn’t just accept but encourages you to show up as is. It says, come as you are, darling.  I add the darling in.<br />It is safe here. Come, darling, soften inward toward your breath.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-04T14:23:28Z,2131

"Hi Adriene! I&#39;m really enjoying your yoga. You have a very soothing voice to listen to and that&#39;s important when practicing yoga. I have a question for you. You said in one of your videos that you are from Austen, Texas so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s where you&#39;re taping from with your 30 day challenge. But do I see snow in the background outside?",Norma Lisoy,2021-03-24T16:00:13Z,0

"regarding what you were saying about the breath: i recently finished your first 30 day series from six years ago before beginning this one. the first thing i noticed when i began this one was how much your voice dropped, which i would attribute to the practice with the breath and relaxing of the muscles around it. it would seem you have leveled up 😊",Joel Vining,2021-05-06T20:13:25Z,0

"Day 3 complete, yay! This practice was exactly what I needed today. I am in a period of transition in my life, where my fear of letting people in is slowly slipping away and I am letting go of my past neuroses, negative thoughts, and loneliness. With this new openness and connectedness I am experiencing comes an officious voice of dread that says I will never be good enough for any of it. New experiences and new people are coming into my life, which I am so grateful for, but at the same time it all strikes a familiar fear into my heart and the urge to perform for these people or things, or to cower away from them, often comes to the surface.<br /><br />Spending this time on the mat, connecting with my breath, feeling the energy flow within me and really paying attention to the nuances within my body, and knowing that others are on a similar, beautiful journey, all helps me to realise the weight of what I&#39;ve carried throughout my life and what I no longer need to carry. Thank you, Adriene, for your amazing presence here and for this soul-serving series!<br /><br />P.S. I am really excited to listen to your upcoming conversation with Russell Brand!",H Spikey,2021-04-30T09:03:18Z,0

"I Keep coming back. It&#39;s not just a good workout... the Breath helps me to hear my inner self, my inner life and Spirit.<br /><br />Today, when Adriene asked us to speak lovingly to ourselves... I felt an overwhelming feeling that it&#39;s ok to love yourself, even while I&#39;m so imperfect in so many ways, it&#39;s ok to love myself and be kind to myself.<br /><br />Then... when she talked about the miniscule muscles we&#39;re are using with our breath... it reminded me of the lesson on cells I was giving to my kids... how we have trillions of tiny cells composing our body, little universes within my body working hard to give me life and energy... and I felt grateful for all the hard work, all the life, all the joy, all the stretching and reaching in the middle of the opposition of life that my body has given.<br />And I thought... it&#39;s ok to love my body... <br />Not like I love my body because of whatever shape it&#39;s in(which is fine), but I love it because of everything it gives me and does for me. Constantly.<br /><br />See. It&#39;s not just a physical workout. It&#39;s something more. And I&#39;m incredibly grateful for that.",Andrea Hill,2021-03-12T16:52:54Z,0

"Хотелось бы поделиться своей истории.<br /><br />Мне всегда казалось, что нужно следить за своим телом, поэтому я старалась заниматься силовыми упражнения. Но это не приносило такого уж удовольствия. Результаты, конечно, были, но для чего, если процесс был не из любимых. <br />Совсем недавно, в декабре 2020 ночью, увидела видео как йога изменила мою жизнь или как я делала её год. под видео советовали этот канал. так что я недолго думала и решила следующим же утром начать практику. и я ни разу не пожалела о свое решение. <br /><br />это то, что мне подходит, здесь есть нагрузка и есть растяжка, но самое главное, есть связь со своими ощущениями, чувствами, телом, эмоциями. есть ощущение настоящего. <br /><br />это моя вторая 30 дневная йога, и после этой сессии так хорошо. особенно позвоночнику и мне, спасибо, что делаете нас здоровыми и счастливыми &lt;3",shoutaro,2021-02-17T08:33:51Z,0

"commenting for accountability (day 3): commented on day 1 that i&#39;d keep writing about my journey but felt incredibly discouraged until i saw a comment from someone on this video with this accountability title and it made me a little more comfortable to do it knowing i&#39;m not alone.<br /><br />felt a lot of resistance to do the practice today, but remembered adriene&#39;s voice complimenting us everytime for showing up, so i told myself &#39;i just have to show up.&#39; took a break in the middle of practice when it got too hard, took some water and a breather and kept going. <br /><br />i keep comparing myself to my performance when i did the &#39;true&#39; series, and i&#39;m trying to reshape these thoughts by telling myself that each journey is their own, and each journey is a chance to get to know my body in new ways. trying to be kinder to myself and all :b",spiderwick,2021-02-04T12:22:41Z,0

"I find the ujjayi breath sound very distracting instead of anchoring, but in its place I focus on &quot;clean&quot; breath and the rolling movement of my body, and find an amazing connection to my body&#39;s energy in that. Focusing more on my chest&#39;s movement rather than the throat / inhalation also helps me make my breath more natural too, as I usually breath at a different rate to Adriene!!

Nice relaxing class. Concentrating on the breath in this slow and mindfull class is very nice but I noticed that the calm was not fully in sync with you talking.

I noticed a definite difference in my practice today. I&#39;m already getting stronger and finding more stability in my poses only 3 days in. But I&#39;m a little concerned about my teeny tiny twig wrists... you always say to not collapse onto the wrists and I feel like that is 100% happening without knowing how to correct it.

"What I love about home practice in general and Adriene specifically is that it&#39;s ok if I can&#39;t do the whole routine some days.  My knees aren&#39;t great, and some days the lunges are too much and I sit on the mat and do ground poses until we can &quot;meet&quot; in a pose I&#39;m feeling up to.  I like Adriene because she reinforces that idea of &quot;do what you can, and listen to yourself.&quot;  There&#39;s definitely a place for a motivational &quot;push push push&quot; instructor, but that&#39;s just not what I&#39;m looking for!",Shadlyn,2021-01-14T23:01:47Z,0

"Hi fellow yogis. 🌈✨ I just wanted to pop in and ask a question. Does anyone here suffer from upper hamstring pain and know how to prevent this in their yoga practice? I love yoga with my whole heart and it does wonders for me, but I (silently and slowly) injured my hamstrings years ago in high school when I first started my practice. I thought I was much more bendy than I was. I now have high hamstring tendinopathy (pretty much tendinitis where my hamstring inserts into my glute). I am on Day 3 and I can&#39;t do a forward fold comfortably without pain. Does anyone have any remedies for this or has anyone experienced this? Thank you so much and I&#39;m sending love. 💛",Landann Brown,2021-01-12T04:06:32Z,0
"ive never been able to touch my toes, not as a kid, not when ive been doing yoga everyday for months, never lol, it might not be super helpful but personally I just bend my knees quite a bit when doing forward folds, and I&#39;ll usually take a break to straighten my legs if its particularly long :) good luck with everything!",Kyla Claassen,2021-01-13T06:08:35Z,0

Love the Ujjayi breath! My favorite place in the world is ANY ocean that I can sit on the shore and glory in the sounds of the waves. I live in AZ so that doesn’t happen often enough for me. As a singer I’ve spent my entire life learning to take inaudible deep breaths so as not to distract from the music and my own voice. This was new for me but so satisfying as I got to do my yoga in AZ today by the ocean. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,Liesl Bloom,2021-01-11T18:57:43Z,0

Because, I can&#39;t breath out trough my mouth when I keep my lips sealed. I was so confused.",Anouk de Jonge,2021-01-08T17:49:21Z,0

"Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriene!!! I am on a healing journey, have been for about 5 or so years. I was relinquished for adoption at birth. This trauma and the subsequent trauma of being placed into a new and different family impacted me spiritually, physically, and emotionally. My body has stored that trauma until now. My adoptive parents chose to not tell me about being adopted because they said I was a very sensitive child. They had 2 biological children right after I was placed with them. They did not wish for me to feel less loved and wanted than my brother and my sister. But even though I did not have the knowledge of my relinquishment or my adoption, my body knew.  A confusing place to be for sure. At 20 years old I accidentally found out that I was adopted. The impact of this knowledge is difficult to describe. Honestly, for the next 25 years I think I was in shock from this new information about myself and my reality. Denial is a powerful thing, it was my native language. Anyway, recently I have been working with a somatic experience therapist trying to learn how to be more &quot;in my body.&quot; I was completely disconnected from my body, my feelings, and my self. She is an incredibly gifted therapist and has helped me tremendously in learning how to experience my feelings that I have always up until about 5 years ago kept numb because I did not think I could feel them and survive. SE therapy and yoga (with breath work and mindfulness) have changed my life. As an adoptee, being in my body has always felt unsafe. I am slowly learning how and experiencing being grounded and growing in feeling safe. The slow, gentle, patient, and endearing way that you lead yoga is enabling me to actually feel relaxed in my body. Hyper-vigilance is one more gift that my relinquishment gave to me. I have tried so many different ways to not hold my breath and my body so tense, but I have had no success until yoga. But who you are and how you speak and what you draw attention to is like magic. It truly is a balm and an aide assisting my body to not hold the tension. Thank you.",authenticity 68,2021-01-07T06:49:53Z,1

"Can anyone share their thoughts on this? Eversince day 1 in forward fold, Adriene emphasized rooting through 4 corners of the feet to rise into mountain. I have practiced this before but since that day 1 it felt very different, like I actually began rising from the feet and felt a lot of activation in my hamstring when rising ( so much that their actually sore ). It felt good but I have been wondering if this is safe way to do it or the correct way to do it idk. I&#39;d love to hear others peoples thoughts on my experience. p.s sorry I am a few days behind but intend on doing all 30 and continuing for a lifetime after that :)",Derwin Dominguez,2021-01-06T20:04:15Z,0

"I am not gonna lie, showing up to this practice was way harder than i ever experienced it before. I did the 30-Day Challenge last year and was so excited to come back this January. And in the first practice I was breaking down crying because it was so hard to hit play on the video. My body and I disconnected so much during this pandemic and everything was aching the last two days. I had to skip this days practice and thought I failed already. But i came back to it today. It wasn’t easy but i am proud for showing up and i will come back tomorrow and hope to connect to myself again after all of this. Thank you and thank you all in the comments.

"Today&#39;s anchoring meant to reach my thoughts to the breath every moment, like acknowledging it. Also introduced Ujjayi breath, deep breathing with lips closed, which the sound of exhaling is like the sound of the ocean. Today&#39;s practice had many Warrior 1 and 2 poses and many plank poses and downward dog right after another which made it very difficult at the end on my arms, legs, and thighs but managed to do them all. <br />The mantra of today was my breath is my anchor, my anchor is breath.<br />I feel too relaxed now.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-06T10:58:55Z,0

Every day of this practice rspemembers me of a course I did back in university. I graduated as a speech therapist and two of my courses were about breath work. We did them ourselves. One part was in a group and the other parth was with breath therapy with our teacher. I miss these therapy sessions a lot. The massages in alignment with the breath work are so healing and comforting.,Daniela H.,2021-01-06T08:29:31Z,0

"I&#39;m glad I am not the only one starting this 30 day challenge  a couple days late. I&#39;ve been especially stressed and anxious these past couple of weeks, so I am trying to myself a favor and do something about it this week. On an especially anxious day I decided to try some yoga and I have been doing it every morning since. It has helped sooo much. For my first challenge ever I am doing Adriene&#39;s Breath 30 day. I am also taking a week break from Youtube apart from Adriene&#39;s videos lol. Maybe eventually I will limit it to once a week. I need to feel more present in my own life and stop just watching others living theirs. <br />Sending love out to any one else that is also stressed and anxious :)",AllThatsStriped,2021-01-05T20:24:10Z,1

"I love these Videos and am so grateful for this! Thank you Adriene! The only input I have: In the beginning of the videos, where we should arrive and focus on our breath and settle in, it is really hard to actually be still and focus on the breath with so much vocal input from you. Everything you say is good input but at the same time it gives almost no time to relax and focus on the breath. But hey, maybe others really appreciate this and this is just me ;) Thanks again for providing these awesome videos and I wish you all the best!",Mimi Dudli,2021-01-05T20:11:16Z,0

I would not though that for people like me with very tight hips (a big part of the reason I do yoga) sitting cross legged for more than a few minutes is torture. I have now adopted the “do what feels good” mantra and no longer feel compelled to stay in this pose but use the time to do twists or the butterfly pose.

Sometimes we fall off track. We are human, and all have our own struggles.

"Alrighty, technically it&#39;s tomorrow, but it&#39;s yesterday somewhere in the world right now. I showed up and I&#39;m feeling pretty good. I feel like I&#39;m clawing my way back to where I was. Today I was able to reach up on the twist, I did a couple planks without putting my knees down, and I could feel my heels wanting to touch down on downward dog. My body DOES remember some of this stuff. :) But I feel the best about showing up. I could have just called it a night and gone to bed ( I almost did), but I want to keep this promise I made to myself. I want to keep my word for my own sake.",the happy mezzo,2021-01-05T07:22:15Z,0
"Namaste Adriene! I feel so happy to have learned this new Ujjayi breath from you. At first, I felt that I could not get it, but I kept practising. Also, I watched your recommended video to learn more before today’s class, which helped (practise before practise, lol). <br /><br />My Ujjayi breath with my mouth closed was quite exaggerated, and I made all kinds of odd sounds, including a gurgling sound in the back of my throat. Then, I realized that maybe I was trying too hard (a usual problem for me, along with forgetting to breath). So my breath became a whisper soft form of Ha, of the way that I did it with my mouth open. I felt so gently happy with this outcome. 😊 <br /><br />I also found your visual of my breath fogging up a window when my mouth was open, with a heart drawn on the glass, to be so appealing. It became a good visual image and memory cue for me, for how I could make it happen again, once I caught on. So I mentally repeated this, a few times. <br /><br />Also, it was a great challenge for me, to sync up the breath with movement. So in order to keep my focus on new breath going as much as possible, I found that I need to do the movements very gentle today. Which was good as I am sore and tired. I also incorporated many mods, inspired by all the wonderful modification advice, kindly posted by people who took yesterday’s class. Namaste all! <br />🙏😊🦋👯🌈💖🧜‍♀️",Renée aka Saffron Stargazer Lily,2021-01-05T07:21:10Z,0
"Holy crow, Adriene, I&#39;m going to have Schwarzenegger shoulders by the end of the month! At the same time, I love how you are focusing on the breath.

"This is my third year participating in your 30 day challenges, Adriene. As I shared in my first year, you helped me overcome a sciatic injury. Forever grateful! After yesterday&#39;s practice, I shared with friends the importance of returning to ones breath when your mind/body are fighting poses - it&#39;s like I knew what today&#39;s session would hold! I find that asking Google home to play ocean sounds as I practice really helps with Ujjayi breathing. You always know just what we need. Thank you for seeing us through the beginning of 2021!

I took just a few minutes to really think about what I wanted to do.    I kept hearing go to your mat, and so I did.  I am so grateful that I listened to what I was being asked to do.

Am I the only person who has felt energetically/psychically drained after the videos for the last three days? I’ve done the 30 days with Adriene since Yoga Camp and I look forward to it every year.

"I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling this way..

My left and right shoulder seem to be out of balance... when I go into downward dog my right shoulder “shines forward” as Adrienne would say but my left takes some more time to get there. Does this mean I am weaker in my left shoulder? or does this mean I am more flexible in my right shoulder?

II have had chronic knee pain and edema for the last 6 months. It came out of nowhere and none of the specialists can say why except Im going into menopause. No-one mentioned menopause mentioned  an cause acute chronic pain that mimics fibromyalgia. So I told myself if this is how it is then suck it up buttercup and show up because it can only help.   And  I can’t do everything but I do all that I can. Why can’t we do this 365 days instead of just 30. I’ll show up. 🤪,Michelle Shaffer,2021-01-05T02:32:04Z,0

"As a recovering perfectionist and someone on the journey of rediscovering my voice, I greatly appreciate Adriene&#39;s facilitation. It&#39;s so easy for me to constantly be looking to the teacher in any space to measure whether I&#39;m doing it &quot;right,&quot; instead of exploring and listening to myself. Thank you Adriene for the few times you reminded us that while you are facilitating the time that the space is ours and should serve us. An empowering reminder that I&#39;ll take with me throughout my day!",Vinnie Casanova,2021-01-05T02:12:14Z,58
"So glad you mentioned this. When I tried yoga many years ago I figured out I was doing Competition Yoga-every day I had to be &#39;better&#39;.

"I can totally relate. I started doing Yoga last year and I started with another of the 30day challenges with Adriene and I could only do 10 to 15 min of practice. <br />I dont know if this helps you but what I did was take breaths. I would pause to video and take 5 long breaths. When it felt my body just couldnt do it any longer I stopped and promise myself to come back another day and finish it. This practices have been long but something that could help when there are short practices is complement the practice with one from Adriene&#39;s foundations series so you can better understand the pose. <br />Also if you dont want to quit the video you can stop when your body is done and wait in corpse pose to the end. The important thing is to show up, as she says, is to get your body to the mat cause with just that movement you are fullfiling your commitment to your body. <br />I hope this aids you a little going forward and it isnt to preachy. I just relate cause I literally didnt do any type of movement before this.",Paulina Ortiz,2021-01-05T01:48:04Z,0

"As always, thank you for this lovely practice. For anyone like me who has asthma, Ujjayi breath can be a little helpful at slowing and potentially preventing an oncoming asthma attack when it&#39;s triggered by activity. When I hike, I always make sure I have my inhaler handy (as you should too!) -- but I have noticed that if I start to struggle with breath on a steep incline, I can stop and often calm my lungs down until I can get a full breath again, using Ujjayi breath. Something to try and see if it helps you too. (Obviously, you know your own asthma and if you are past the point of no return, use the inhaler or get help! But using this technique may help you, as it&#39;s helped me, to reduce my inhaler needs.)",Valerie Fenton,2021-01-05T01:16:19Z,0

A good thing to keep in mind for yoga and life in general.",Walsh Pettibone,2021-01-05T00:35:38Z,0

I loved it.  I use the Ujjayi breath almost as a default in my yoga practice.  I learned it in an Art of Living course years ago.  You are the first person to mention it since.  ON a funny note - I was totally in the zone in child pose and on an inhale a tiny mosquito came in my nostril - I was thrown a bit off for a moment.  Thought you&#39;d enjoy a chuckle as I did.,Janice Lutz,2021-01-05T00:22:33Z,1

"Here&#39;s how Ujjayi breath changed my life. Because of my deviated septum I used to have a cold every winter, several times a year actually. And I was used to struggle with breathing during very hot, humid summers, and when doing exercise, and when it was cold and...well, you get the gist. Since I started practicing Ujjayi breath I slowly ceased to have all these issues. I haven&#39;t had a cold in two years now, and every time I find myself struggling with breathing I turn to Ujjayi and it literally opens my lungs and nasal cavity. Where lots of medicines and thermal baths failed, simple breathing made it.",GiudittaVonKleist,2021-01-04T23:19:57Z,0

I unknowingly always breathed the ujayi breath after working out and before I go to sleep. I had in my mind the image of a dragon breathing a smooth flame; It&#39;s really cool that this was a thing.,PotatoDragon785,2021-01-04T22:58:06Z,1
"Ah. I just love Ocean breath. This summer when I began trying it, I didn&#39;t get it or feel very connected to it. But my own ocean sound and rhythm started to develop with more practice (if that makes sense), and now I just delight in it. I even noticed that my body will kind of melt into it naturally if I&#39;m feeling anxious, instead of holding my breath like I used to! This is huge for me. Thank you, Adriene. You are such a beautiful teacher. ❤️",Kat Abrams,2021-01-04T22:54:43Z,1

"I&#39;m gonna have to ask a silly thing, but I don&#39;t own a TV and my notebook is broken, so I am watching and practing with my 6&quot; phone. The things is when your fighting not to colapse and try to see what your doing in a tiny screen is really hard when you&#39;re wearing the same color scheme as the background. I almost fell lots of times trying to see what was going on as I couldn&#39;t tell which was you and  which was the window. So, please, try brighter colors. It makes it easy to see you. Thank you very much.",Bibiana Azevedo,2021-01-04T22:51:56Z,0
"During day 1 and 2, I found it difficult for me to really take deep breaths and focus on my movement and breath, because I&#39;ve been going through a lot of anxiety and OCD and my mind couldn&#39;t help but wander into dark places, no matter how hard I tried to focus on the practice. When breathing in, it felt like I was stuck at a certain point, as if my body or mind didn&#39;t allow me to breathe in any further. Today I still had troubling thoughts but felt much lighter when stepping onto the mat. I really loved that we were practicing ocean breath today because it was new to me and I focused on it much more. I smiled a lot throughout the practice. By the end of the video,  I was able to take the longest breath I&#39;ve taken for quite some time now, I think. I was surprised how I wasn&#39;t stuck at a certain point and instead really felt the air I was soaking in through my entire body. It felt like the biggest physical relieve after days of battling my anxious and intrusive thoughts. I feel so light now, Adriene. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart ❤️",Julie,2021-01-04T22:51:34Z,0

I keep doing this thing I was doing in vocal class where Ic clench the lower abs when breathing out, and trying to locate the airflow right behind the nose.

"I loved learning this breathing practice, and I loved the mantra, my breath is my anchor, my anchor is my breath! I struggled a little learning to do the inhale with this breath, but I found it was so great learning to sync my movement with my breath. So soothing.  My job has me activating the sympathetic nervous system so much - to find ways to pump the brakes and activate my parasympathetic nervous system in my shift is probably critical to maintaining a healthy mind and body - I’m going to incorporate the breath as my anchor into my daily activities at work.

"Got to say I was not looking forward to another longer one today lol really wanted a short and sweet one today .....but wow this was wonderful and it hit all the feels for me. Got me sweating and saying a little &#39;oh come on adriene&#39; at the screen when holding those planks lol but wow that breath work in this one was exactly what I needed !!!! And this one actually ended up feeling short cause I was so concentrated and just really in the ZONE with the breath ! Gotta say first 2 weren&#39;t my fav but thats mostly my fault for letting myself sary off my mat for months so I am out of shape and with chronic back pain it feels extra hard but I&#39;m determined I&#39;m going to get back what I once had ...the strength   the flexibility, the breath...all the things AND hope its therapeutic for my pain again once I&#39;m past the really hard begining! This one was spot on and just what I needed to tell my mind we got this, even when my body is screaming no we dont 😉 I can do this!!!! <br />And also it really is something to check numbers when I start video and again when I&#39;m done. LOVE the idea that I just did this with 20,000 others around the world! This 35 year old lady from Ontario Canada is waving at the rest of yas saying we got this WOO HOO!!!!

"Our dear friend Graham has needed a ventilator to take his breaths for nearly three weeks now. He was my favorite DAWG today. To all who read this comment, please take a moment to send out a positive thought or prayer for our &quot;buddy-bud&quot; Graham. &lt;3 Thanks, Adriene, for creating this beautiful environment in which we are encouraged to take care of ourselves and send loving thoughts to each other.

"Thanks to everyone who commented here in support of our buddy bud, our dear friend Graham, who has now joined the angels. The day he transitioned, I was a day behind in the journey (having stayed two days on the super yummy &quot;Snuggle&quot;), and that day I did &quot;Connect,&quot; which had the first knocking on heaven&#39;s door that I remembered in Breath. Instead of giggles, there were tears, but also a smile and acknowledgement that we are all connected and there was no coincidence in that timing. I am filled with gratitude for the love and dedication that flows through this community. Thank you! 💓🙏",Vicki V,2021-01-26T00:37:08Z,1

I struggle with being disciplined and since I’m working on that, I decided the least I can do is make it to the mat and see what happens. After every yoga pose from today’s exercise I thought this was it, this is my limit , I’ll fold the yoga mat now. Yet God and my body got me through the entire practice AlhamduliAllah, I couldn’t have been more grateful and proud of myself.

It&#39;s been frustrating and constant and a whole bunch of different meds have done almost nothing to control it. I started a daily practice with Adriene over three months ago just after my cough showed up, and within a few weeks, the cough was gone with no sign of it since! I spoke to my doctor about it and she believes that all the breath work Adriene has taught me basically worked as therapy on my lungs. She got incredibly excited to recommend this to other patients, and is going to start doing yoga with Adriene herself. I&#39;m so grateful for this practice for so many reasons but I wanted to share this one small thing that has made such a big difference in my quality of life.

This 30-day Yoga challenge is the medicine for my tormented body and mind. I have been going through some rough time with my parents and it impacts my health. They can&#39;t accept my family - my partner and his daughter in my life. They can&#39;t accept my happpiness and my way of life and only criticise and hurt me. I am at a point in my life when I seriously consider cutting all ties with my parents. <br />Yoga with Adriene keeps me sane and going for at least 30-50 minutes a day and is a perfect escape from my thoughts and feelings.

How often do we know what we need to do to heal ourselves and we don&#39;t do it? I am tired of choosing what doesn&#39;t serve me, and being stuck in old patterns. It&#39;s time to get back to my practices that ground me and heal me. Thank you Adriene. To anybody reading this, I hope your journey brings you healing and clarity.

To all the mommas doing this with little ones running all around them. Invite them to join you if they will! Teach them about calming breathes and how important it is to connect. And for the little ones who don’t have long attention spans (mine 🤣🤣) make a busy box that you just bring out during yoga sessions. Put fun little activities in it! Give them a snack and make sure their drinking cups are full. And allow yourself grace that you may have to still pause the video multiple times!,Cheriah Herring,2021-01-04T18:03:21Z,0

"Thanks, Adriene, for another amazing lesson!! When I&#39;ve tried Ujjayi in the past, it has only been on the out breath, and it was more nasal than from the throat, if that makes sense. I love the way you took us through and explained it, and for the first time I tried it on the in breath. I&#39;m now excited to check out the video you posted, to learn more. Also wanted to add that I loved the mantra!",Tracy Spuehler,2021-01-04T17:56:41Z,0

Grateful  for this session. The breathing was awesome. I felt the sweet relief of tension that I often carry in my sacrum.  I’ve been waiting for that as I found it in the past during practice with you.  It happened during a side body twist during a warrior pose. I never would have found that on my own as I’ve been trying for quite some time.  Finished up the last minute in my bed. Ready for sleep after my night shift at work.  Ahhhhhh.  😁,JOXGIRL1,2021-01-04T17:50:13Z,0

When. We came down to the floor and I closed my eyes and started doing Ujjayi breath my cat came over and sat right on my hips and then moved up to my chest and just purred and purred.

This year I&#39;m taking on a lot of challenges so the focus of the breath is great as I try and tackle this year with focus and self-discipline!

"Day 3: oh, this one felt GOOD.<br /><br />I had to stop and start three different times during the first eight minutes of practice because of other things going on, and even as I was finally settling in, I found myself wondering, am I going to manage to keep focus at all?  And then I started picturing the ocean.<br />Keeping focus is SO HARD for me with yoga sometimes!  I can take my body through the movements, but being present in the moment is so difficult.  But today, I found myself visualizing some combination of every beach I&#39;ve ever visited in my life, the swell of waves up and down, for the whole practice.  Sometimes I was still as a rock with the waves crashing around me.  Sometimes I was laying on the beach listening.  Sometimes I was the water.  But it WORKED.  I was here with the practice rather than off in my head churning over anxieties or other things, not distracting myself by focusing too much on Trying To Focus.  Things flowed together.  I didn&#39;t keep getting messed up because Adriene&#39;s breathing rhythm was slightly different than my own, because it was easy to picture the ocean just changing tempo a little and flowing with it.  I kept plank pose way easier than usual (way longer than yesterday!) because I wasn&#39;t concentrating on trying SO HARD to keep all my muscles in place, I was just being a steady pier surrounded by water.<br /><br />Heck.  If I can keep remembering this technique, I think I can DO this.",Clarity C,2021-01-04T17:10:26Z,0
"I&#39;ve never done the ocean breath with movement before. It was so interesting and made me feel like I was in a moving meditation. So much mental peace after each of these practices. Thank you, Adriene!",sara2382,2021-01-04T17:10:05Z,0

"So... I have this anxiety when it comes to audible breath. I think it started when I was a kid and I was a mouth breather LOL. My anxiety got worse  when I went into theatre school and all we did for the first year was focus on the breath. Theatre school was a competitive environment and I would constantly perform with my breath, because well... it was theatre school. Anywho! What Adriene said about the Ocean Breath not about performing, it really resonated with me. I find that I perform for others and myself a bunch. So to allow myself to find this time to let that go was so satisfying, albeit scary. Thank you for this wonderful day three. Can&#39;t wait for tomorrow!",Lisa Alves,2021-01-04T16:35:12Z,0

"Hey Adriene, <br /><br />Long time viewer of yours but recently something has been brought to my attention. Yoga being “taught” by white people is cultural appropriation. I’m ashamed to say that I wasn’t aware of this until today and I haven’t been able to put my phone down since I came to this realization because I am having one consistent thought continuously swirling around in my mind “how did I not know this sooner.” My phone is no longer being used today for social media, calls, or texts, I’m using my phone today to start on my research journey of yoga and cultural appropriation specifically, in the United States. I encourage you to do some thinking and research on this topic yourself being that you have such a large platform with SO many viewers and subscribers. I am concerned that your not aware of this and I hope I can raise awareness by typing out this comment to you. It’s my job as a white person to raise awareness to other white people...it’s your job as well. I really hope you read this.",Lexi Marie,2021-01-04T16:33:12Z,0

"I felt so calm that I stayed in meditation for a couple minutes after video ended and after that spontaneously kissed myself to the fingers and whispered &quot;dziękuję&quot; (&#39;thank you&#39; in polish, my native language) which was short for &quot;thank you for doing this video and sticking &#39;till the end but at the same time being gentle with yourself, despite falling asleep at 7 am and sleeping for only a few hours last night&quot;. So, well, yes: thank you, myself. And thank you, Adriene, for creating an opportunity for practicing with you. With love, namaste &lt;3",Lizzy Mad Hatter,2021-01-04T16:32:41Z,0

"I am really enjoying this Yoga series so far. It was recommended to me by a friend (who has mentioned Adriene&#39;s yoga videos before). I am not sure what took me so long. This is excellent though honestly the first serious Yoga I&#39;ve done in three years. Ujjayi breathing is interesting but ultimately I think I&#39;ve done this sort of breathing before - in labour, but didn&#39;t really know it was an actual thing.",Emily Cerantola,2021-01-04T16:31:08Z,0
"My intention was not to not look at the timestamp of how far we are in the practice - it&#39;s not because I&#39;m bored, it&#39;s just my mind wandering and wondering what is coming next.

I even loved feeling the burn in my legs :D Arguably I took a couple of child poses (including before the last downward facing dog and extended child pose, yay for double relaxation!), but I did &quot;full planks&quot;, so there&#39;s progress from yesterday. Most importantly, I loved practicing Ujjayi breath, which is something I do naturally and unknowingly. When you talked about taking fewer breaths but extending the inhalation and exhalation, I thought: &quot;Yes!&quot; This is also what I started doing recently, as I&#39;m working on stress management and trauma recovery.

"When I used to do gym yoga, one of the most used cues were for ujayi breath: “Your neighbor should be able to hear you.”  It dud become more of a performance.  The loudest yogis were viewed as the “best” ones.  One guy did it extremely loudly even during savanna’s a, where it became so disruptive that a classmate spoke to him about it.  Thanks to Adrienne for maximizing the breath and inner peace and minimizing the ego.",Ellen Lederman,2021-01-04T15:32:05Z,179

This is the first time I am trying to do the the 30 day series in 30 days. I am really enjoying it but my wrists are not. I have had problems with my wrists and elbows before. Today I could not do all the downward facing dog poses. I took breaks and modified a little. Any suggestions for the days to come?  I am afraid if it gets worse I won’t be able to continue. 🙁,Sarah Dolislager,2021-01-04T14:58:37Z,0
"Thank you so much for your encouragement!  I, too, will spend time in child pose instead of downward facing dog to give my wrists a break. I will remind myself to show up and breathe.",Sarah Dolislager,2021-01-04T17:27:48Z,0
"I&#39;m by no means an expert, but I do have trouble with my wrists and now shoulder due to injury and what has worked for me is to try the pose as is first then modify as my body tells me it&#39;s approaching its limit. I&#39;ve spent many times in child pose as a result or doing plank with my knees down. But with time, my wrists have slowly gotten stronger. I always modify as a general rule to meet my body where it is, but this series specifically is excellent for mods because the focus is the breath. So I figure as long as I&#39;m breathing and staying in my body, it&#39;s OK if some days I spend the entire practice in child pose and mountain pose. As cliche as it sounds, the point really is the journey. Hope you are able to continue yours. Sending lots of positive healing vibes to you.",gtrisha,2021-01-04T15:16:01Z,1

Thanks Adriene (And Benji) that was awesome as always! Loving this year&#39;s 30 days of yoga! I have never missed a year since you started doing them. I&#39;d like to let everyone know about chanting the Bing Bong!

"Is there a foundations of “comfortable seat”.  Even seated on a blanket, it is not comfortable in my hips.",Gina A,2021-01-04T13:00:28Z,0
"It took me a really long time to become comfortable sitting on the floor and occasionally my back is still unhappy about it. On those days, I simply lay down instead (there&#39;s also the option to sit on a chair/couch, though I personally prefer to keep close to the mat).  <br /><br />But generally, I think it just takes the body some getting used to (and the more flexible I get with yoga, the more comfortable it is as well). <br /><br />It might be helpful to begin each session with a bit of sitting so your body can start getting used to it, then transition to lying down when it gets too uncomfortable. From there, you can increase the amount of time you stay in a seat each day.",Nikki E,2021-01-04T13:49:06Z,1

Been doing my practice at 8pm (Qld Australia time — after the kids are in bed) and is a great way to wind down after a day. Perfect way to relax into the night before bed too (even though today’s session felt like it was an increase in movement). Day 3 👌,Melinda Edwards,2021-01-04T10:33:26Z,1

"Adriene I love using the Ujjayi breath, it’s something I use often to focus on my practice or even in bed to get to sleep, counting 5 in, pausing, then 7 out, better than counting sheep 😂. I notice as we go through Day 3, we are slowly building on the previous days, adding a little more and gaining strength. As we flow through those vinyasas, I think it’s perfectly ok for us senior yogis and maybe some less able, to use elbows and knees to help us transition through. I made it fine and my cobras are improving. Instead of feeling hopeless it makes me feel positive and satisfied. Early days, but we can do this, each day an adventure.

"Although I was intrigued by yoga for years, several trials of intimidating military-drill-style power classes, parades of fancy yoga merch and eye contact avoidance left me feeling I just wasn&#39;t cut out. I tried Adriene&#39;s videos in April 2020 as an attempt solely to address back pain which was becoming a constant. Yoga then felt like a doorway to joy in being in a way I never thought was possible for me. It has helped to foster an openness and flexibility of mind beyond ideas of fitness and strength. A real game-changer. So so grateful &lt;3",Salma Hassan,2021-01-04T08:46:08Z,41

"Getting on the mat was a bit of a struggle today. And half way through the practice I felt like getting into to child&#39;s pose and cover myself with a blanket. I did, but came out of it after a few breaths to continue the practice.

"The first day was pretty challenging for me. I was having a really hard time synchronizing my breath to my movements and also to the video (I think because of my asthma; my lungs felt constantly full so my inhales were too short and my exhales were too long; so my mouvement was always shifted from the rhythm of the video, which I know I&#39;m not bound to following but it was still very unsettling). Yesterday was a little better but I still felt really frustrated because I couldn&#39;t do the entire practice (tight schedule). Today, however was great. Ujjayi breath is a great great tool that I haven&#39;t had the occasion to really dive into (pun intended) despite the fact that I&#39;m not so new to the practice (good reminder of how we always, always have something to learn). <br />Anyways! This was long! Thank you for your time if you&#39;ve read this far. <br />Thank you Adriene for this yummy practice. I&#39;m really feeling like I&#39;m tuning in with my breath a little more already. Thank you so much.<br />Sending mad love to everyone practicing wherever you are. <br />Do really great today (or sleep really tight =D )!",Hazelnut Meg,2021-01-04T07:02:02Z,2

"I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like doing yoga later in the day (5pm in Victoria, Australia) as I&#39;ve been doing it earlier in the afternoon or in the morning since starting in October. I thought I&#39;d wait until the next day to do each practice. But I&#39;m actually really loving it so far! Great way to wind down after studying and whatever else I&#39;ve been doing before moving onto dinner and the rest of the evening",AllonsyLaura,2021-01-04T06:40:35Z,63

"Hi Adriene, thank you so much for this new challenge!  I have been practicing for a month now with you and i can really feel the effects on me. It is really motivating! For those of us who are practicing from the other side of Earth (team France here), would it be possible to release the new video a little earlier so we can have an early morning practice? I totally understand if it is too much complication for you, but i thought i could try to ask! Anyway, thank you again for everything :)",Pauline C,2021-01-04T06:29:01Z,4
"Hi Pauline! The videos are released at 12am Texas time/7am France time. After years of trying different things, we&#39;ve found that this is the best time for our team and those around the globe. Some who do not get the video early enough choose to practice the next day. If you choose to do that, know that you will not be alone. x",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-04T14:34:16Z,1
My body was angry getting to the mat today! Sometimes it&#39;s easy to wanna just &quot;get yoga over with&quot; but I truly appreciate Adriene reminding me to take stock of body pains and refocus my awareness of my body so I listen to what it needs.

"@Nidhi 👍☺️ maybe you could just cut 2 pieces out of a thick layer of rubber foam material if you live in a place where you cannot buy or order these pads, should do the same job 😃 To have two separate, single knee pads are more practical than a blanket or pillow, because you can just move and remove them around between the postures quickly wherever and whenever you need to cushion your knees during practice or a flow.

"@Ben thank you Ben for your response 🙏🏻 it’s very helpful to hear of your journey and yes yoga really is a journey that deepens us into this awareness of our body, the spaciousness and tightness and the pains we may not have been aware of. I am aware of the spiritual significance of the hips also as storage spaces for emotional pain so that is interesting to delve into. I’ve advised her as you’ve wisely said to move into child’s pose and to move slow throughout and hopefully this will allow flexibility and openness in these tense areas to deepen. Aloha. In gratitude for the journey 😊",Natalie Passant,2021-01-04T11:13:18Z,1

"@Natalie Passant I&#39;m sorry to hear that, that must be very scary and frustrating for her, and you. I started a bit ago and early on was consistently going into child&#39;s pose as the movements would advance or sometimes on even basic maneuvers as I built my strength. No shame in taking a moment. I never pushed unless I was ready and tried to remain patient as I grew. Given all my aches and pains, sometimes hidden also, I have been having to learn my body and finding its weaknesses. My hips and joints are very tight and the nerves love to say hello in each session. The good news is in time for me I&#39;ve seen myself grow stronger, less muscle spasms, nerve reactions, and soreness. My only advice is for her not to push anything that isn&#39;t comfortable and allow her body to speak to her comfort. Chiropractic adjustments have helped as well in realignment on areas that have had years of abuse, especially my sciatica and low back. Good luck and I hope the practice helps in time.

And then I got covid in November and whenever I felt weight on my chest/shortness of breath, all I could do was long, deep breaths.
