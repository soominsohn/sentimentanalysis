"Good morning fellow travelers on this journey today I came to the mat and it looked like January(about inch or two of snow in the yard ) . Thought I had hit a time warp and some how caught up with the first group   but I made it to the mat none the less, see you tomorrow .",David Cates,2021-04-21T14:29:17Z,1
"Adriene, I very much appreciate your videos and your love. You&#39;re a pro and everything you do seems so effortless. However, in my (very clumsy) experience these transitions are waaaay too fast for beginners and heavier people :/",Laura Tárkányi,2021-04-18T18:19:59Z,0
"Woooof, this particular session really resonated with me. My anxiety is so bad lately and I feel as though I have lost control of my own breath. Thanks for providing the tools to help me slow down! :)",C K,2021-04-15T13:40:13Z,0
"I have loved your videos ever since my friend Janina introduced me to you. They are great for people who are just starting yoga as well as people who have done yoga for years. It&#39;s a nice pace that really helps you establish and maintain your base when it comes to yoga (something even experts can struggle with). I love your message of self-love and your attitude of accepting your limits and doing what makes you feel comfortable- one of the main reasons I joined yoga- instead of &quot;pushing past the pain&quot;. In everyday life I always feel like I&#39;m behind in life and that I will never be enough, however whenever I do your yoga videos I feel enough for myself even if I&#39;m not always able to do all the yoga positions in the video. I recommended you to my therapist since I&#39;ve found it a lot easier for self-acceptance whenever I do your yoga videos as a routine for myself. You&#39;re amazing Adriene and I just wanted you to know that :)",Mollie White,2021-04-11T12:32:59Z,0

"Thank you Adriene. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been on the mat, the longest time since I started, and it&#39;s good to be back. Today I had the time, but could feel myself dismissing the need/desire to do yoga. That&#39;s a bad habit of mine; pushing away healthy habits in favor of cheap comforts. I am grateful that, on session at a time, I am practicing contrary action and building new habits that will build me up and sustain me in healthy way.",Taylor Hill,2021-04-08T00:20:02Z,0

I looooooove this one! Knocking on heaven&#39;s door is a favourite and the perfect way to end this practice. It&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day here in the UK and a friend of mine very recently lost his mum and I dedicated this practice to her and her beautiful family. This practice was so great to commence healing. Knocking on heaven&#39;s door felt so right after this tough time! Peace and love to you lovely Adriene and everyone here ❤️✨,Jennifer Brown,2021-03-14T10:03:01Z,0
"Today’s the first day I truly didn’t want to do yoga. I had honestly already decided I’d skip today. But I know I’ll have to skip another day because of travel later next week, so I forced myself to do this. I thought the practice was going way too fast for me at first, but I think the speed was exactly what I needed today to get out of my head! Thank you for always making my days a little brighter.",Caroline,2021-03-13T17:57:16Z,0

"It was ironic that today we were asked to focus on the quality of movement and not the doing.. because the whole active part of the class for me was way too fast.  I found that to keep up with it, I had to fling myself through the postures, unable to focus on the quality.  I got very frustrated &amp; upset.  I need blocks to go from a low lunge to plank, so it just takes a little more time for me to move through those types of postures.  I&#39;m not sure why Adriene chose to move quickly for this one... but... it didn&#39;t work for me at all.  Actually I learned today that I&#39;m really good at moving with intention.",Lesley Mathis,2021-03-11T03:01:45Z,0

So control for me would usually be going through these movements at a slow and careful pace. I was kind of out of control with the quick transitions and trying to keep up. But the great part was that I was laughing and talking to Adriene.

Knocking on heavens door for a &quot;control&quot; practice, wearing socks for &quot;discipline&quot;, and the BREATH that is connecting all of it. Supplemented with little themes, poems, inspirations, and of course your trusty assistant Benji, this just seems like a body of art to me!<br /><br />THANK YOU for all you are doing and giving &lt;3 I hope, you truly feel how much LOVE grows out of it on this planet.",Nora Jasna,2021-02-20T09:16:52Z,0

"i gotta be honest, i didn&#39;t want to practice today. i&#39;ve had an awful few days and i feel so irritable and messy because of circumstances out of my control. the word &quot;control&quot; caught me on this video, because that&#39;s how i feel: out of control. i was thinking maybe it would make me feel in control again, but then adriene said to focus on the quality of the movement: that was hard. i just wanted to beat myself up every time i couldn&#39;t do something right. every time my shirt felt uncomfortable or my hair felt out of place. every time a breath felt uncomfortable. but then i tried to tune back in and ask myself about the quality of the movement, not if &quot;I was doing it right.&quot; that helped. and then that movement at the end encouraged me to let go a little. and i&#39;m proud of myself for getting through this despite the way i&#39;m feeling. i know my body needed it.",Britt Lyn,2021-02-17T01:56:52Z,1

"Thanks for the great practice. I would suggest to give a space during the practice &quot;without explaining the practice itself&quot;, to give chance to focus on our breath then you can demonstrate later or before, because it´s hard to enjoy the silence while we´re listening to someone.

"Had another little delay the past 2 days and noticed since last night how much I was craving to do yoga again. Back to the mat with this one was like a little present! Control is all I&#39;m craving for lately but not really finding and thus it was the nicer to find it back on the mat within myself. Thank you for that! And ohyeah, during the knocking on heavens door I was wildly in it and my arms where moving from buttslaps to waving in the sky and back again - must have looked like a fairground attraction though😂 - but it was SOOOOO FREEING! Can recommend it to everyone!",JoyKirsten,2021-02-08T23:51:13Z,0

"WOW!! I REALLY knocked on heaven&#39;s door today haha. That control, listening to and trusting myself, giving myself permission to veer off the tracks as much as I need, and also trusting Adriene&#39;s guidance in the speed and timing of the practice, all served me well this morning. When it came to the knocking on heaven&#39;s door, I felt hesitant at first, not because it makes me feel silly, but because I felt like I could find a profound stillness in that moment. Instead, I trusted you, and went ahead with it because I do like that movement. I found myself moving faster and faster with the breath of fire to lead me. It was power. Now that was strength in stillness if I ever felt it. I actually just stood there and breathed for minutes after the video ended! Not even choosing to lay down or sit. Thank you for turning my day around. I will listen to and trust myself in all that I&#39;ve got going on today. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",Valaya Hart,2021-02-05T17:26:17Z,1

Good to know the playback speed can be adjusted. I also found it fast paced compared to the previous lessons which made my breath not as in control. I can&#39;t bring my leg all the way forward from down dog to the position between the palms and I need an extra beat to adjust my foot forward. Each day I do feel an accomplishment having come to my mat. Today I had less balance and was a little shaky maybe that was the faster pace that made me feel I had less control.

"I found it especially hard to keep up with this routine today. This series has been gentle and easing my body back into movement, which is great because I&#39;m not very mobile and suffer from chronic pain due to a spinal injury. But since I need to pad my knees and I can&#39;t physically get into the position where my knee slides under my torso to a lunge with either palms on the ground... I didn&#39;t really know how to modify a large section of this routine. I know the focus was on the breath control insynce with how we move but I got frustrated. I couldn&#39;t keep up with moving the cushion from my knees to come to my belly on the ground and putting the cushion back and adding an awkward movement to the side to get into my modification of lunge. 😩 I know each routine can&#39;t be for everyone.",Hallel Tyler,2021-01-23T18:49:47Z,0

"Today (a day late!) was a humbling experience for me - I have a sore shoulder so was having to modify all of the pushing up/lowering down actions which normally would make me feel like I was being lazy but was able to recognise what my body was telling me...

I am also getting migraines every week now and put it down to what&#39;s going on at the moment.

"I am so grateful for this program &lt;3 I came to the mat today experiencing more anxiety than usual, worried that I would have a panic attack or be stuck in the anxiety cycle all night. But I showed up, got on the mat, and it all slowly started to melt away. Through these practices my mat has become my sanctuary, my safe place. When you talked about our willingness to let things transform rather than being fixed that was the perfect thing for me to hear. I noticed how much, even though I didn&#39;t want to be anxious, how much I was holding onto that fear of the fear, how stiff that felt, and when I surrendered and chose to let it all go, it all really did start to shift. By the end of the practice I had found that sense of peace within me again, and I had the biggest joyful smile on my face :) A huge weight had been lifted and I felt free to move through my life as my truest self again, not weighted down by anxious thoughts. The very first thing that I wrote in my journal was &quot;my yoga mat saves my life&quot;. These last few years I have experienced a level of anxiety/PTSD that truly did take the life that I love away in many ways. But my practice, and these videos, give me back hours/days that I may have otherwise spent in negative or anxious thoughts and emotions. They bring me back to myself and help me to let go of all that does not serve me, so that I can live this one wild and precious life that I have in a state of joy, playfulness, and comfort; rather than being controlled by or lost in anxiety. While I have taken an active role in healing my anxiety/PTSD through reading books, joining groups, going to therapy, and more, I want you to know that your videos have played a HUGE role in my healing/recovery, and I am just so grateful for these videos and this community. Often they are the only thing that can truly shift my energy when I need it the most. My practice, the practice that you have guided me to, truly is saving my beautiful life in such a deep way. Thank you, all of you who make these videos possible, thank you so much for putting this out into the world so that it can reach people like me. Much love to you all &lt;3 &lt;3",Scarlett,2021-01-23T09:04:10Z,0

Adriene ! I would like to know if you have any advice on my mat rolling out ! I usually roll my mat up after every practice. So then obviously naturally when I go to unroll it the end of the mat wants to roll back up lol! Before every practice for like 5 minutes I just put a weight on the one end so then during my practice is isnt annoying ! Is there a better way I should be doing this ? I just can’t keep the mat unrolled 24/7 unfortunately:( love your videos ! I’m very proud I’ve made it all 21 days so far where in the past I’ve given up at like 14. Thanks for the great content always ❤️,Kaitlynn Healy,2021-01-23T02:04:41Z,1
What I have found useful is to try rolling it a little looser or roll it inside out so when you roll it flat again the curved ends are facing down and work with gravity to flatten.,Earth_Mama Wolski,2021-01-23T02:14:36Z,1

"Couldn&#39;t get the YWA part of my day until after dinner - so my belly was in the way of my folding - but on a forced exhale, much more space to be found. I didn&#39;t want to bother my house so streamed the practice into my hearing aids and turned off the loudspeakers. However, my butt spanking was audible as was my Lion&#39;s breath so family was curious of the beastie noises and the spanking sounds.

"Today I had a huge realization. That made me stop mid practice to say “WHOA”. Every time Adriene had been telling us to do ‘harder’ modification of a pose (ex. Plank instead of knees on ground) I chose to do what I thought would make me stronger. “I have to do plank because I’m strong”. Today - when she told us we could lift our knee in the lunge twist- I heard myself saying “DO IT”. And that’s when the realization hit. Instead of pushing myself to do the “harder” “higher level” pose, instead I can honor my body and where I’m at that day. Yoga (and life) isn’t about pushing yourself into what’s difficult, what you think is the right “better” way to do things. Find what feels good in your own body! Trust that you know what’s good for you in each moment",shae25251,2021-01-22T23:46:41Z,1

"Today was the first “bad” day i’ve had in a long time. After 2 breakdowns and things just really not going my way, I almost opted for a run instead of doing yoga. Traditionally running is my favorite stress reliever- the mundanity of one foot in front of the other, being able to shut my brain off. But today I chose to continue with the 30 day yoga journey and i am so glad i did. Instead of “numbing” my mind- i found conscious peace today. Thank you Adrienne, and thank you to everyone practicing with me, even on the bad days. Namaste 💜",Alyvia Todd,2021-01-22T22:22:47Z,115

"I nearly burst into tears during this practice because I suddenly noticed a ton of improvements all at once. <br /><br />1. I used to have quite a bit of lower back pain transitioning from mountain to forward fold, today there was none.<br />2. I noticed planks felt sturdier and easier.<br />3. My heels NEARLY touched the ground in downward dog! So excited for the day they do! <br />4. This is the biggest one. I dread three-legged dogs because I&#39;m never able to hold them for more than a few seconds and it&#39;s a struggle to do even that but I was able to do the entire duration of circles in three-legged dog and it only started feeling like a struggle near the end. So pretty decent strength improvements! <br /><br />If this is how far I&#39;ve gotten in just 21 days, I&#39;m so curious to see how far I could get in 6 months or a year of regular practice. I&#39;m a little blown away to be honest.",watermelancholy,2021-01-22T22:11:14Z,1

"I love how all of these practices are so connected, they seem to meet up with my healing journey so perfectly, and grow with me. I often focus so much on everything I cannot control. I can feel like I&#39;m drowning in it, especially as I navigate grief right now. Thank you for reminding me that I can bring my focus to my own power. That there are things that I can control. It&#39;s a balancing act in this healing. I am surrendering to what I cannot control and walking by faith, because we were not meant to control it all, we are held by something bigger. As Adriene pointed out, we don&#39;t have to look down, the earth will be right there to support us. But we liberate ourselves in finding the pieces that we can control. In making the choice to move with love, to show up, to be brave, to give ourselves what we need, and find joy when it arrives in the present moment -- today it was noticing the snow suddenly blowing outside my window in the middle of practice. Thank you so much, Adriene. These practices are saving my life. Every day I count on daily practice with you as my landing place. It is often the best part of my day. I know I don&#39;t actuallyyy know you, but I really love you so much. And Benji too, of course. Haha. Namaste to you both! And everyone here. This community is just so full of love. Thank you for lighting my candle of hope daily. 💓✨",Kat Abrams,2021-01-22T22:02:37Z,2

So many favorites this 30 Days!  You always know just what I need before I do!  How do you do that?!? I have been struggling with some stiffness and fatigue this week but I&#39;ve been powering through and making it to the mat everyday.  I found myself doing &quot;knocking in heaven&#39;s door&quot; before practice even began.  This practice had me smiling.  P.S I have the start of carpal tunnel and absolutely loooove the wrist stretch while on all 4s.  It&#39;s helped a ton!   Thank you Adriene!  Namaste.,Jessica Seppala,2021-01-22T21:34:38Z,0

"I don’t want this comment to come across negatively or critical because it is not meant to be. My Breath sweatshirt arrived yesterday and I am wearing it today. It just fits, only just. I ordered the largest size. (I normally wear a size 16 or XL but ordered the 18, hoping it would be a big baggy). I am just wondering if in the future there can be a larger range of sizes for merchandise? Yoga is so great at any size or age(I started my practice in my 40’s and am now in my 60’s). There seems to be this myth that yoga is only for the thin and the young. I’m sure that is not something you would ever want to perpetuate. I’m just wondering if in the future there could be some larger sizes so that anyone doing the 30 day challenge, regardless of size, would be able to have something that fits comfortably.

Perhaps it&#39;s the routine of me unfolding my mat every day, or maybe it&#39;s your calming voice; but she comes and lays near me and I realise because of this I look forward to this practice every day but for a completely unexpected reason now.<br /><br />I just wanted to pass on - as you have a gift and you may not realise how generous it is to us all xxx",Charlotte Hjort,2021-01-22T19:35:40Z,0

"Threw me off so hard with the &quot;lift the left leg&quot; followed by &quot;left knee down and right leg forward for lunge&quot; XDD <br /><br />Interesting discovery in the &#39;knocking on heaven&#39;s door&#39;, after I loosened up some, actually felt better to make the movement from higher in the chest than from my thighs and hips, loosening my shoulders and ribs more than my hips and lower back..... perpetually tight in the shoulders since I was a kid who spent too much time on the internet 20+ years ago :/",dirtywhitellama,2021-01-22T18:54:29Z,3

"Does Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door make anybody else nauseous?  I&#39;ve tried so many times to embrace doing it, thinking oh maybe today, I haven&#39;t or have eaten recently, it is earlier or later, etc, but if I speed it up at all I end up feeling icky.  I&#39;m trying to find what feels good, and if I just do kind of a figure eight slower sway I&#39;m ok.  But I don&#39;t get to smack my butt and Adreine always encourages us not to skip it, so I feel like I&#39;m missing something good :(",Carolyn Knorst,2021-01-22T18:48:52Z,1

I found today’s practice quite difficult lots of downwards dogs and bringing your leg forward I can’t get my leg to the top I thought to myself maybe I will warm up a bit so I did it for the second time it went a little bit better this time but still the transitions were quite fast and my muscles were struggling but I thought to myself that’s fine it’s day 21 maybe my body is just a little bit tired I am doing my best turning up every day when we did knocking on heaven‘s door I got a little emotional I don’t know why never happened before when I was doing yoga Lots of acceptance today needed that maybe something so never get it perfectly right but that’s not the point the point is to discover and develop and breathe as you go along ...,lidia budzinska,2021-01-22T17:52:32Z,6
"Agreed. I had some difficulty as well. When the pace picked up, I was a bit lost to catch the rhythm at first but caught up where I could. I think Control taught me a lesson that I’m not perfect and not everything is in my control but I can learn from it.",Micah Hodges,2021-01-22T22:39:33Z,1

I need to also remind myself that it is okay to go a bit slower than what is happening on the video because we will all make it back together at the end. I will say though, Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door was EXACTLY what I needed to finish the practice off today. I love that move always and forever!

"Two thoughts <br />1. I don’t think I could transition form on my knee to off in the twist.  But I heard Adriene’s voice telling me to try so I did and I could!  Small victory physically but big victory mentally. <br /><br />2. Knocking in heavens door nauseates me. Every time. The last three times I skipped it ( find what feels good).  Curious if anyone else experiences this.  I am easily nauseated person ( thank you, child birth and pregnancies). I usually just go free style for the knocking in heavens door.  Wondering what others do to simulate this act.  <br /><br />Thanks Adriene for another great practice.",Tammy Sack,2021-01-22T13:38:19Z,2

It seemed like a slow practice, but Adriene was moving quicker than my body was tonight. That is okay so long as we feel the movement and maintain presence. I just knew knocking on heaven&#39;s door was coming as we turned on the mat. Adriene&#39;s manner gave it away but was glad to sense it coming. 💜 Enjoy!",William B,2021-01-22T13:17:12Z,0

I just can&#39;t get my foot up to where it needs to be without adjusting and getting behind. I don&#39;t &quot;flow&quot;. I&#39;m exercising to get healthy and eliminate body fat but the body fat is in the way of my exercise. I&#39;m trying REALLY hard not to get discouraged. On the fun side, my cat will come under my face in down dog, tickle my nose with his tail, and then do a more perfect down dog than I could ever imagine.

"Love doing knocking on heavens door! <br />I&#39;ve been doing yoga at home for a while and have gotten super used to just trying to find what feels good and letting go of any shape comparisons or feeling silly. Of course it&#39;s easier to do within a solo home practice and Adriene&#39;s kind guidance has gotten me here, but today as I was shamelessly smacking my booty with my chest out and head held high I wondered if I would be able to carry this feeling, this way of movement to a public yoga class. I guess there&#39;s still some time until I can find out the answer with our endless lockdowns here in the UK, but I love what we are building here!",Saziye Tasdemir,2021-01-22T11:49:30Z,0

I wasn&#39;t feeling like myself  and this practice reminded me that for sure there are things I can&#39;t control off the mat(and that&#39;s okay) but that I can always go back to my breath and take one step at time.

"I love how perfectly this practise matches how I&#39;m feeling each day. Sometimes all I can do is show up and I don&#39;t feel like pushing myself to balance in the lunge, sometimes I do! I think it&#39;s teaching me a lot about paying attention to how I feel and adapting accordingly rather than trying to push myself do the same thing every day regardless of my energy levels. I love it!",Clare Lindley,2021-01-22T08:54:00Z,1
"To be honest, today&#39;s practice felt like a breach with what we&#39;ve been building up over the last weeks. Wanting to breathe slowly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and pay attention to the &#39;how&#39; of the movement, I felt rushed through the postures and then frustrated. I felt I had no time to find what feels good. And maybe even more so when there&#39;s was plenty of time to knock on heaven&#39;s door, whereas there had been too little time for all that came before. Perhaps this was the underlying idea, but the control and enjoyment I&#39;ve felt until now, was interrupted by today&#39;s practice. I hope to recover the build-up tomorrow... Not really used to this happening in the 30-day yoga journeys, I really love to join each year.",Floor VA,2021-01-22T08:47:57Z,0

Today i was struggling with holding my balance while taking on my sock. You know this awkward moment when you stand there in your bedroom half naked trying to not fall over. And then there was a  little voice in had and it said: engage your core! Remember your center! And what should i say - i didnt fall over and found my balance. :),Emilia Branse,2021-01-22T08:37:45Z,2

"I&#39;ve been thinking about control and how somehow enduring pain gives me that sense of control. today my wrists and arms hurt more than normally and I couldn&#39;t even come to all fours because the weight and the stretch in my wrists was too much. I spent most of the practice in extended childs pose (I did the knocking on heaven&#39;s door though! :D) and felt really disappointed, because my first impulse was to suffer through and do this &quot;for me&quot;.

I&#39;m struggling a lot these days with accepting AND respecting (physical and emotional) parts of me and the &quot;smacking&quot; bit of today&#39;s practice got me all psyched up feeling and expressing: THIS IS ME, with confidence and bravery.

My neck and head so restricted they act like a block rather than individually.  The session was too fast for me, I&#39;m totally new to yoga. I did think for a brief moment when watching the rewind I can&#39;t do this, then realised I am doing this, not brilliantly but am doing it. I just focused on a couple of poses not the sequence.

"When we do Knockin on Heaven&#39;s Door and you suggest syncing up the breath to inhale on one side and exhale on the other, I try it and start to get dizzy. I guess I&#39;m too focused on the rest of the movement to get a deep inhale in such a quick amount of time. I usually end up in a rhythm that is closer to one inhale for three sides (ex. L-R-L), one exhale for 3 sides (ex. R-L-R). FWFG!",rachelrossos,2021-01-22T07:03:12Z,25

@MrsFrappucchino the secret is to not think!,Randy Conrad,2021-01-22T08:01:07Z,1
"well, I think this is only partly right. You can of course to some extent control what is inside - but you can never totally. I think this suggests that you can just change your thoughts/struggles by thinking very hard to be happy which is just not true and for me, creates some toxic positivity. You can of course always try to shift things inside of you 😊",MrsFrappucchino,2021-01-22T07:56:26Z,3
Just got my new liforme yoga mat today!! After 3 years of practice I finally invested on a pretty decent mat. Usually I wait till either 6am or 6pm after work to do my daily yoga but I’m so eager to practice on my mat I’ll stay up lol,WomillionBazillion,2021-01-22T06:02:40Z,22
