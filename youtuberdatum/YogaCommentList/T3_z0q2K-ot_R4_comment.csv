"Today was great. I was tired, not looking forward to &quot;Strength&quot; but it was great. I did it all. Feel wonderful. I don&#39;t want to sound like I would not like longer sessions, but THANK YOU Adrienne for finding the right session length. It is perfect, and I can make it daily. When I did yoga eons ago, classes were 1 1/2 hrs. ... took a lot of commitment.",Deale Hutton,2021-02-14T20:25:26Z,0

"i&#39;m not gonna lie, I saw the title &#39;strength&#39; and I thought it would be a day with cardio, but no, I love what Adriene said that sometimes we have to find our inner strength while we are still and found our inner peace!

"This is a magic practice throughout the thirty days. Today, something very special at the end which I interpreted like this: the thing about being brave and courageous, and putting yourself out there in the world, is bound to bring us to make mistakes. And when this happens to be still, quiet, gather our resources. An amazing lesson. Thank you Adriene x",moonfruit,2021-04-30T08:02:36Z,0

"Today I missed my usual hour for the practice (that&#39;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0q2K-ot_R4&amp;t=22m30s"">22:30</a>, since I practice yoga and go to sleep right after) and I thought: “well, I did 18 days in a row, there&#39;s no harm in skipping a single day...” but then I remembered that that&#39;s what always make me quit. When I start letting days pass without practicing or working out, then end up quitting. I know it. Also, yoga helps me sleep, so I decided I&#39;d practice today too, even though it&#39;s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0q2K-ot_R4&amp;t=00m00s"">00:00</a> right now and I&#39;m about to doze off 😂 I&#39;m glad I did it even though I was tired and didn&#39;t really want to.",Daiana Chaves,2021-04-10T03:06:05Z,0

"I always started doing Adriene&#39;s 30 days yoga challenges for the past 4 years but there has not been any time that I managed to complete in 30 days, the first 2 times I didn&#39;t even complete. This year due to a medical condition I got to start at March and now it is going great, I am only 2 days behind my own schedule! With these challenges every year I get to observe not only my physically improvement but also how more determined and more steady I become as years pass by and as I become more mature. If there is anyone out there feeling stressed out because they are not on their time like I was a couple years ago, let it go! Our timing only depends on us and the right way we feel, everything improves by time.",Alanay Sude Türkmen,2021-04-08T06:57:39Z,0

These videos are not only about yoga, but also about finding small messages between the lines. <br />&quot;Find that ocean sound today.<br /><br />And, remember, that sound is for you.<br /><br />And maybe your higher power, if you wish.<br /><br />That sound is between you and your angels.<br /><br />This is where I gather my strength.&quot;  <br /><br />Lots of love.",Adriana M.,2021-04-07T17:30:52Z,1

And - I&#39;m doing it because I enjoy it, rather than because I &#39;should&#39;. I&#39;m a full-time secondary school teacher in the UK and am spending most days Zooming pupils to deliver lessons. At the end of the day, this really has been a joy - to get in touch with my body and to be mobile, as well as to learn about the breath.

"So I took a two-day rest because I was feeling knackered and sore. And the title &quot;strength&quot; scared me a little. But now I&#39;m back! And I&#39;m feeling a little silly, seeing it wasn&#39;t as bad as it was in my mind. Plus, I&#39;m seeing day 20 is &quot;pause&quot;, so if I had done this yesterday, I would have had my &quot;pause&quot; anyway. Here struggling to let go and not be a perfectionist, as you can see... <br />Anyway, I&#39;m really trying to master my breath. I&#39;ve seen lately in so many sites that breathing in the chest is really bad, and we should all try to breath through the belly. Exactly like Adriene teaches. Mykie, from Glam and Gore (makeup Youtube chanel) is having serious health issues just because she breathes in the chest instead of the diaphragm. So I&#39;m really trying to pay attention to it and be conscious.<br /><br />Thank you, Adriene. I feel like my anxiety eases a bit after these practices. Námaste.",Olga,2021-02-23T09:12:02Z,0

"I love how I&#39;m noticing strength building up as I show up to the mat 5x per week (I&#39;m kinda taking the weekends off) my experience today in doing this yoga session proved to me even more that I&#39;m so much stronger compared to when I first started! Reader — you might&#39;ve experienced a similar thing, and I&#39;m celebrating you for being here and for showing up to the mat! 🎉🥳✨<br /><br />Quick story: I started practicing yoga last 2018 (with Adriene&#39;s 30 Day Yoga Challenge) and practiced regularly until last year. So like I haven&#39;t practiced yoga regularly for a year or so, then I started with BREATH on January 12, 2021 where I found my limbs and muscles shaking even when simply in downward facing dog. At first, it was discouraging, but I followed Adriene&#39;s advice to follow my breath throughout the practice and focused on how I feel and what my breath is telling me. So one day at a time, I started to build up my foundations again and really enjoy the journey. I&#39;m very happy with where I am today, and I commit to really integrate yoga in my lifestyle even after completing the BREATH journey in a few days from now. ☺️🤍",Lynelle Suan,2021-02-04T10:49:18Z,2

Somehow I don&#39;t enjoy this series as I did the other years and I&#39;m wondering why.

From resting my knees there",Marta,2021-01-25T22:51:42Z,0
Aside from color coordinating with Benji 🤩 this was perfect sequence after the centering session. It helps knowing how to properly use the center instead of “hauling” the body. Thanks again Adriene for teaching me how to properly use my body! 🙏🏻,Carol Miller,2021-01-25T20:37:42Z,0

"I&#39;ve been very reluctant to do this video, as I had a hospital procedure and went on bedrest and this was the first back (with my doctor&#39;s okay). Although my body feels as weak as it&#39;s ever been today, I learnt so much about strength. Moving super slowly and doing the practices in the smallest gentlest way instead of &#39;hitting the pose&#39; taught me so much about self-kindness. Even mountain pose and corpse pose felt a bit much to hold at times, so slow gentle modifications were essential. The stillness at the end and gentle pace helped me learn that strength isn&#39;t all about speed and aggression, but willingness to show up even when &#39;failure&#39; is likely and you feel far behind what seems like &#39;everyone else&#39; in the journey. Thank you, Adriene 💖. Namaste",Nicky Watkins,2021-01-24T13:32:28Z,0

Hello Adrienne. I am feeling good as a result of practicing with you through your BREATH series. Last year I enjoyed your HOME series.<br />In between I have chosen a program that felt suitable each time I came to my mat. Thank you for giving us at home yogis a chance to keep practicing.<br />I would like to request that you put together a session on how we can improve our facial and neck muscles.  There is the lion pose and the neck rolls and the drawing circles with the nose. I am wondering if you know of more postures that would assist with toning this much ignored part of all of us. <br />Kind regards Suzanne (Australia),Suzanne Wilkins,2021-01-23T22:36:39Z,1

"The comment section is a beautiful place to be on this channel, I love this sense of community and I can tell we have all been on our own very meaningful journeys. Something that resonated with me during yesterday’s strength practice was when Adriene said “there is an amazing, almost poetic strength, from building the relationship with your breath” and I loved her emphasis on finding strength in stillness. I am learning that this aspect of the practice so important. Thank you Adriene for guiding us through this 30 day yoga journey. I already know I am saving the playlist once it’s complete to re-visit :)",Grace Fuizzotto,2021-01-21T17:29:40Z,0

"I got REALLY close to skipping today&#39;s practice, which would have been my first skip of the BREATH journey. I had already gone to bed. That was it. I had put a cross instead of a check in the yoga column of my habit tracker for the first time in so long.<br /> But then oddly enough I couldn&#39;t fall asleep (which is funny because I usually fall asleep very easily plus I was exceptionally tired today) and after squirming in my bed for a few minutes, I hopped on my feet and laid my mat. I&#39;m really proud of myself for finding the STRENGTH to. <br />To everyone, to you who struggled as well to make it to practice, to you whom this practice saved today, to you who just arrived, to you who&#39;s coming back after skipping a practice or a few: You&#39;re doing great, high five yourself, you deserve it!

"Two hours after doing this wonderful practice with Adriene and you all, another of my &quot;fitness angels&quot;, my YMCA tabata instructor, said to us (during a pretty intense class) - &quot;Focus on your breath.

We don&#39;t work out to tune out, we work out to tune in!&quot;   Hhhmmmm - pretty great sequel, wouldn&#39;t you say?",Ellen P.,2021-01-20T23:56:48Z,0

I am content that I practiced and I will take one practice at a time, thank u Adriene much love Namaste 💞❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2021-01-20T23:53:21Z,1

"Sometimes I can swear that Adriene is there practicing with us. She says some things that resonates so well with what we&#39;re going through, it&#39;s awesome.<br /><br />For example, today at the end she talks about the importance of recognising that we fail, that we are humans, and about how we need to stop, breath, focus, and try again sometimes.<br /><br />I did yesterday&#39;s practice today by the morning, not yesterday (PMS is kicking my ash this week), but I was feeling so low and frustrated with myself that I couldn&#39;t focus. At half of the practice I just gave up at the half of every pose, and wasn&#39;t able to concentrate on anything that I was doing. <br /><br />I ended the practice feeling really really bad. But then I focused on my breath, on my center, and tried everything again.<br />And I did it. Not perfectly, but did it. And then today she talks about failing and trying again. 💕<br /><br />I have nothing to say but a gigantic thank you, to Adriene and to this lovely community 💖",Bruna Mandu,2021-01-20T23:17:08Z,3

"I struggled today. But I felt good having struggled THROUGH. I didn&#39;t want to come to the mat today, but I did. Building strength is helping me come to terms with my changing body as it gets bigger as I get older and with the pandemic having stopped me exercising as normal for many months, and to try and embrace it as my body nourishing me and allowing me to do such practices and build my strength in a way that isn&#39;t scary and sweaty and filled with as many reps and as much sweat as possible. <br /><br />Thank you for this journey and the small and invaluable lessons you give us everyday to help us love, accept and build upon ourselves.",Alexandria Dixon,2021-01-20T22:36:06Z,1

"Some days, life is just struggle, <br />I have two teeth missing because I had an accident when I was younger. Now I have implants to replace them,<br />I can seems like it&#39;s not a big deal, and a lot of people are suffering with conditions way worse than that, <br />But today the relationship I have with this part of myself is very difficult, it gives me a lot of anxiety, and sometimes physical pain, or at least this is what I feel,<br />Some days, this burden feels really heavy, I&#39;m young and it&#39;s scary to think I will have to live in term with this for the rest of my life. It&#39;s just unfair. I really struggle to accept it. It&#39;s like I don&#39;t have enough strength,<br />But when I&#39;m on the mat with you and Benji, I feel the relief, the peace, at least for a moment. And I get a sense of what direction I should aim to,<br />So thank you for being here Adriene &lt;3",Samuel Bordes,2021-01-20T17:39:18Z,0
Day 19!! ❤️  I work with pre-school age children so a lot of my day is running around / jumping / bending up and down picking up toys etc and usually my back would be beyond killing me and my energy levels be zip by the end of the day but I&#39;ve been finding I&#39;m able to do those things with much more awareness of how to do it to protect my body and how to breathe and that because of daily practice my scoliosis and my aches and pains don&#39;t bother me as badly and even if they do as soon as I get on the mat again?

Completed today&#39;s challenge with the inaugural address in the background. Unity is the path forward!,May Westman,2021-01-20T17:17:55Z,0
"I&#39;ve never commented before, but just had to say this course has been amazing for me. I have a severe disability - multiple herniated discs in my lower back and neck, even after several surgeries to fuse a few of them. COVID shut down the pain clinic here where I received monthly injections, and as a result I ended up bent over and unable to straighten my back. I thought I might be stuck this way forever. I tried exercising on my own but without guidance or motivation I just ended up hurting myself more. I joined this challenge as several of my friends were doing it, and even though I can&#39;t hit many of the poses (Cobra is far out of my reach!) I have modified as necessary and done the best I could. This is the FIRST yoga practice that has moved slowly enough, with good transitions, encouraging modifications and listening, and on day 8 I noticed a strength I hadn&#39;t felt in several years. The instructions are excellent, this is the first yoga I&#39;ve done in my life that didn&#39;t kill my wrists! I still cannot stand up straight, but I am a tiny bit straighter, and that is HUGE for me. Thank you Adriene for yoga that is accepting and loving and allowing EVERYONE a place. I am already planning to do another thirty day course when this is over, I believe I have found my way back from living the rest of my life bent over and getting more and more disabled as a result. I now have a target to be standing upright within six months! I didn&#39;t know it was possible, and now I believe it is. I cannot thank you enough.",Ruth Savage,2021-01-20T17:17:15Z,0

Adriene! Thank you soooo much! Today’s practice and this entire 30 day journey has truly been useful. I always find a little bit more ease and strength in my everyday crazy life because of your beautiful soul. ✨💗🧘🏽‍♀️🥰🌱🌞,Gabrielle Bayan,2021-01-20T15:56:23Z,2
"Got my Covid vaccine yesterday, and my arm is so sore that I was worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to do today&#39;s video - especially when I saw the title. Glad I gave it a try - there were definitely some challenges, but I listened to my body, made modifications, and I&#39;m so happy I did. I feel accomplished, and the movement&#39;s helping with the soreness. Thank you for today&#39;s practice!",Carrie McGraw,2021-01-20T15:54:32Z,12

"Thank you Adrienne, At 80 years old, I am probably one of your oldest followers. I was really missing my classes until I found you on I tube. Usually I don’t have too many problems in following your instructions but feel I might be a bit slower than most. Also I have osteoarthritis in my wrists so have to take care there.<br />Nevertheless, I feel much better after every session!",Sally Williams,2021-01-20T15:52:43Z,2
"Hi Sally, WOW! I, at 76, thought that I was most likely the oldest follower. I&#39;m thrilled to learn that I&#39;m not alone. AND, you have said everything that I would say, including the comment about osteoarthritic joints. Know that I look up to you and admire all that you are doing to be active and stay healthy. Adriene truly shares her message of love.",Leslie Nixon,2021-02-09T22:25:37Z,1
"Wow Sally, you are inspirational! Your comment lifted me up to know I am doing this class at the same time as you. Sending you a virtual hug! 😊🧘‍♀️ You are amazing for being here, don&#39;t discredit yourself. This 35 year old complaining about random aches and pains is going to stop complaining and hope I can be like you!👍",Shelly,2021-01-20T16:23:18Z,0

"Thank you, thank you. As ever, this one has come at just the right time for me. I&#39;ve had my son (nearly 9) in tears today because he&#39;s missing his friends with not being at school (UK lockdown). I&#39;d been nagging him all morning to do his school work so when he broke down in tears I felt awful. I felt like I was letting him down. Him and his baby sister went off to my mum&#39;s and I broke down in tears about it all. I knew I had enough time to get on the mat before starting work and was greeted with your smile and lovely Benji and instantly felt better. I was laughing doing the heel lifts in goddess. And then at the end, in corpse pose, hearing you talk about strength, I started to cry again. But this time saying to myself &quot;You&#39;ve got this! You&#39;ve got the strength to carry on. You&#39;ve got the strength to be there for your son.&quot; It was like you were talking to me personally, like you&#39;d made the video just for me to raise me up. You&#39;ve helped me so much over the years but this series is really resonating deep. Again, thank you Adriene xx",Fiona Lindley,2021-01-20T15:46:07Z,17

Adriene I have really enjoyed your 30 day yoga videos. I just finished day 19 strength. I love it. I like that you take things slowly and take the time to teach us how to breath through the movement.

"I realized recently that, even with a home practice, I had this impulse to try to do things perfectly in yoga. Whether it was a pose or even just breathing, I thought things needed to look or sound a certain way to be &quot;right.&quot; This journey has been encouraging me to really listen to what&#39;s already there and how I feel. It&#39;s such a relief to let go of expectations, listen to my natural breath, and tune into what&#39;s already inside.",Alisa Hartle,2021-01-20T14:15:11Z,0

It&#39;s interesting to be able to look at my apple watch and see how many calories I burn each session. This one I found I did a little more than usual! This was a rough one for me because I&#39;ve been my most sore yet from yesterday&#39;s practice and probably the one before it. I didn&#39;t realize it was that short and paused it a few times (something I&#39;m working on :)). I might even do this one again later knowing what to expect now (aggressive - I know). But I enjoyed this one and am saving it for future sessions. A nice change. Go Adriene! Don&#39;t too many of these though it might kill me =) =),Dani Sibelman,2021-01-20T13:07:02Z,0

"I went back into the classroom for the first time since March yesterday. I came home and was exhausted, both emotionally and physically. Getting up this morning early enough for this practice was TOUGH. But I told myself &#39;I&#39;m doing this for me. I deserve it.&#39; and I got up.

"I am such a perfectionist in every aspect of my life and this is strongly tied with anxiety over anything but doing yoga every day for the past year taught me that there is happiness in being imperfect, in moving my body, in accepting my limits and how my body looks. I have strength in me even if my mind tells me the contrary. I may not be able to do push-ups for long but the fact that I showed up on the mat is already such a huge win over the fear of not being enough to do the practice to the end.

This resonated very strongly with me as well! Especially since I was struggling with crow yesterday and beating myself up for it. I have to remind myself that every day my body is different and that this is a process. It doesn&#39;t matter if I can get into crow or not. What is important is that every day I am showing up for myself and trying. And if I fail all it means is that I tried.

"Adriene I have a question :) I am loving this journey every day.  I have practised yoga on and off over the years but never consistently like I am now.  However I wondered if you could give me some guidance/insight on a way to avoid tension in my shoulders, one in particular.  This is a reoccurring pain I get in the front of my shoulder and in my armpit.  It doesn&#39;t hurt when I am doing yoga but afterwards it burns and can become quite unbearable. I just wondered if you might have some insight to help me breath and move into a healing space here.  I have a very stiff body and flexibility is a challenge for me.  Anywhooo, would love to hear from you or any other wise souls in this community if possible.  Thanks!  Oh and have a beautiful day :)",Kate Lewis,2021-01-20T07:41:53Z,0

"Morning everyone. Enjoyed this session, it was slower and more specific for me, easier for me to grip.  Have a lovely day everyone. Stay safe. Namaste",Daniela Witten,2021-01-20T06:57:12Z,4
"Paying close attention to how you move around, marrying the movement to the breath, even names like &quot;Goddess pose&quot; make this practice so much more interesting and enjoyable. A &quot;classical&quot; workout would have said &quot;do 20 wide squats and 10 push-ups on your knees&quot;. Same exercises, very different approach. <br />I love that Adriene constantly reminds me to think about the tiniest details in my body. This video could have been an hour long, I don&#39;t think I would have noticed. Still, pleasantly tired after 23 minutes. :)",Csilla Haag,2021-01-20T06:55:24Z,0

"For me, one of the most beautiful sounds of life is listening to the heart beat. It makes me feel gratitude for this big warrior, this familiar stranger that has been there since the first second I started my life journey. And since Day 1 of the Breath journey, I get thrilled listening to Adriene’s heartbeat during the sessions, &amp;  it’s like listening to mine &amp; to that of all the people across the globe who practise with me. 🌟🌟🌟Thank you for the music, Adriene!

"Ok, wow! This practice made me realize something very important.<br />I&#39;m on my period today and I was already afraid of that day because I still wanted to keep going with this 30 day yoga journey. When I read the title &quot;strength&quot;, my brain told me that I can&#39;t do this today. It was like &quot;Okay, you lost it. I mean feel your body. It feels so vulnerable today.&quot; But I was like &quot;No! I&#39;m gonna listen to my body and just do my best. No expectations.&quot; And guess what? Today I needed less breaks than on &quot;normal&quot; days! Cause I always expect that I need to do it as good as Adriene - even though she always says it&#39;s okay if we&#39;re not where she is. And it totally is. But my brain keeps telling me lies.<br /><br />This was such an eye-opener! ❤️<br /><br />Edit: I just reloaded the page. We were 1421 people practicing together 🥰",Sammy C,2021-01-20T06:35:16Z,2

"I need to know this too. Typical yoga mats are not wide enough for me, but most importantly are not long enough - in lying down poses either my head or my feet (or both) are off the ends of the mat, and it interferes with focusing on the work AND with getting back up again.
