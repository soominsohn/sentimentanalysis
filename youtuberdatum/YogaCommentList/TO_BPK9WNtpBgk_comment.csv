"I wrote a bit today before doing this yoga sesh, I was telling myself to choose self-control, to choose what I perceive to be a better version of myself, which in essence is to choose love. We got to the namaste and I said it over 5 times. And I told it to myself again, as I always do after saying namaste: &quot;To the very best version of myself. To the very best version of ourselves.&quot;<br>And ofccccc your Sunday newsletter/love letter goes, &quot;I choose to embody my best self.&quot;<br>Thank you Adriene. <br>Journey mates, we are still alive, that means we are in this and as such, we got this, we ARE this.

@Gill Smith  I am extremely jealous you live in a village. You are pretty much living my dream life right now.  How about we swap places after the world opens up again? I&#39;m amazed how colder the weather Out on the peninsula then inland! No wonder I was way off! It looks like you guys just got hit with the snow. I hope it doesn&#39;t do any damage to your plants that were starting to come out?  We should really be living in climates that are better for our sensitive bodies but we are lucky to live near the water. I am feeling better mentally. Those vibes you sent are working wonders. I just need to let you know earlier before it gets too bad. <br><br> Now that I&#39;m feeling better I totally think I can do tomorrow&#39;s yoga just sitting down. It&#39;s amazing howI can be more creative and flexible when I&#39;m not being eaten alive by demons. I&#39;ll see you in the comments. I guess you&#39;re probably going to do it right now actually cause it&#39;s in the morning there.,Laura Reed,2021-04-07T04:12:14Z,0

"So for me today is day 3 of the Renew calendar and I woke up late. I was starving, so I had breakfast (tamales to be exact). I didn&#39;t feel able to go through the 36 minute session with downward facing dogs and vinyasa, and although I felt like cheating all along, I chose this lovely, magnificent, gentle 22 minute session. And when Adriene said, it is in the intention of working towards something, not shying away,  suddenly I felt more at ease. I am doing the work and maybe sometimes we are so tough with ourselves and trying to hit all the home runs, when in fact some days you just need to do your best while honoring your tamales for breakfast.",mariana campos,2021-04-03T18:10:07Z,50

"This might be my favorite of your videos. It&#39;s bright and cheery, both relaxing and stimulating. And as added bonuses:  Benjy sleeping throughout, your mention of Zoolander and making the crying gesture, Benjy waking up when you started bopping your feet on the floor, and the final mention to &quot;heck, tell your enemies; the world needs more yoga.&quot; And, of course, a pre-Pandemic class.

"It still amazes me how much better I feel after doing yoga, a fact that I often tend to forget since I&#39;ve been doing weight lifting and hiit training the last 6 months. Today my body just wasn&#39;t feeling 100% to do something intense, I felt tired, exhausted, sleepy. So I turned to good old yoga with Adriene, the one that got me into fitness in the first place 2 years ago. I feel much more alive now, ready to carry on with my day, more awake. We need to listen to our bodies more, some days all they need is some love from us and this channel, this amazing lady here is the best way to do this. I really want to thank you Adriene for being such an inspiration and for being here when we need to reconnect with ourselves &lt;3 lots of love! &lt;3",Maria Mar,2021-03-30T05:52:12Z,0

You&#39;re so beautiful and have such a beautiful heart. This is my first real try at yoga and I had tried a couple other videos first. Yours spoke to me most. I enjoyed all of it. I&#39;m having trouble taking deep breaths though and also can feel tension in my shoulder when trying to reach up preventing me from doing it all the way like I want to. I&#39;m hoping this is just because it&#39;s my first time really trying and hope it will get better.,Haley Love,2021-02-27T20:01:23Z,0

"I had a big meltdown today but at the end of my practice today i was so at peace and smiled, which i haven&#39;t done in some time. In December 2020 i started with the 30days &quot;home&quot; journey. It was really hard at first to just listen to me breathing and to focus on my body. But with time my body got stronger. Now i&#39;m doing the &quot;breath&quot; 30 days and i love it. It keeps me going in the times of homeschooling. Today i went to the mat and started with one video and ended up doing 3 20min practices. I&#39;m so thankful for the opportunity that i have to focus on myself in my yoga sessions. Thank you Adriene, sending so much love from Germany. <br />To everyone else reading this i&#39;m proud of you. It&#39;ll get easier with the practice and i&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking care of yourself with doing yoga!",Becauseidontknow,2021-01-30T19:21:00Z,0

The past year was a challenge for all of us and we are not done with the challenges that came in 2020. Being present, setting intentions, moving forward are crucial if we are to be able to keep showing up in the world. Thank you Adriene for doing this, again. I am so grateful for these practices and the time that you have put into them. May you receive many blessings in return! Namaste.",Heather Jystad,2021-01-01T20:31:37Z,0

"I haven’t been able to sit cross-legged for 15+ years. I haven’t been able to breathe as deeply as I do now. I’m able to be with my daughter more playfully. <br />I haven’t thrown out my back tossing something away or putting my seatbelt on since daily practice. <br />(Embarrassingly small tasks can interestingly disrupt my whole life)<br />I try and remember everyday that everything starts with breath.<br />With my whole heart, thank you",Paul Elekes,2020-12-01T08:26:32Z,0

I really loved this one! It was so relaxing. Thank you Adriene! I struggle with daily chronic back pain from a fracture in one of  my vertebrae and a spinal fusion. My sister recommended your channel to me and this is the end of the third week where I have woken up each day with one of your yoga routines. I notice a HUGE difference in the quality of my days and I can already see progress in my flexibility.  I always ruled out yoga since my spinal specialist said it will likely be one of the things &quot;I can&#39;t do&quot;. But he is wrong! And this has been my saving grace.

"I recently did this yoga session on my birthday October 12th before my ice hockey championship game. In the video you tell us to set our intention for the day. I set my intention to do my best for my team to help win a championship. I ended up scoring the game winning goal in OT to win a championship on my 30th birthday! Seriously one of the most joyous feelings ever!!! Thank you for helping me feel my best before my game! I do your yoga practices everyday and they make me feel so good! I appreciate you so much!  <br />(I Know you have tons of subscribers and I know this may be too far out there to ask, but maybe one day, can you make a yoga session for ice hockey players?)

"I know this is just one of the many messages that piles up in your videos. But I just wanted to thank you for this video today. I have been having a really though time lately. While I am one of the lucky ones with a complete family and honestly, am living a very comfortable life- I know I have no right to complain. But I also am subjected and caged to so many rules with this lucky family of mine. I feel like my wings are clipped and am trapped with no way to escape. It is with yoga practices like this that I can uplift my mood and feel freedom without <a href=""http://judgement.so/"">judgement.So</a> thank you so much for this.

"This was fun. I really liked the part when Adriene mentions how important it is to use the right language. All too often especially in competitive sports, instructors use negative talk with the idea that this instills discipline. While it may work for some, it doesn’t work for those of us who are sensitive and prefer a kind and gentle approach. This video was educational and boosting both physically and spiritually.",Daily Artonaut,2020-09-27T12:46:46Z,66

"that last bit almost made be cry again. so much of what my body does is linked to me feeling angry, hopeless and frustrated. whether it&#39;s hairloss or random pain or anxiety, it&#39;s hard to have calm thoughts when i feel like my body is constantly working against me. yoga reminds me every day that I should choose love, that I need to surrender and that I&#39;m not in control of everything. after running to doctor after doctor I realised that the best medicine in my case is doing all the hard psychological work, getting into a different mindset, no matter what&#39;s happening to me or everyone around me, I can only adjust and accept. I love the kind messages you put in each video, thank you adriene 🖤",seahood,2020-08-28T13:20:58Z,1

"For over a year now I’ve been having numbness, pain, and just overall inflammation caused by sports, my  job, and just being a reckless person. I used to work out a lot but because of the previously mentioned issues its been really hard. I’ve been going to a chiropractor and it only helps a little bit. I went to get MRIs because it has continously gotten worse and they couldn’t find anything wrong. Most days my face, hands, and shoulders will be numb. To get to the point my wife has been following you for years, and because of her I knew where to find you. I’ve been doing yoga on your channel for over a week now and I’ve been able to notice a slight improvement in the amount of energy I have and the numbness hasn’t been bothering me as much. I just want to say thank you for this content it’s really helpful for not only me, but for all people that come across your channel.",jurry Valentine,2020-08-16T10:30:23Z,35

As a parent and teacher, I was in desperate need of something to help with anxiety and physical well-being. I can never stick to an exercise routine. I have now done yoga every single day for the past two weeks because of this channel. Thank you so much for what you are sharing with us all. You are making a difference. Now, I want to study more for myself, but also learn about children’s yoga and mindfulness for when we return to in-person learning at school. My students will need it as much I did.

"It’s been at least two months that I’ve been enjoying your practice. I do a session almost everyday. I think you may be teaching me how to quiet the sciatica (usually low back on right and upper hip). I am also re-learning how to stand and walk on all four corners of my feet. I’ve danced for years but it’s been a long time since I’ve danced in a company. Somehow my feet decided to put weight on the inside. I have small bunions and the one on the right has been bothering me. I’m hoping standing on my feet correctly will help. I know surgery for a bunion is not the way to go; it’s not a bone. Anyway, I love your teaching style. You do things very safely otherwise, I couldn’t follow you. I really, really appreciate that!!! I love your practice! Thank you for all your time!

I just got out of an extremely emotional and at the end physically abusive relationship. I stopped doing yoga and the things I loved all together. In February he hurt me and I had a serious knee and tibia injury. I remember being in the hospital and thinking I might not ever be able to do yoga like I used to. I’m so thankful I am able to do yoga again. This is the first time I’ve practiced since the incident.  I couldn’t help but tear up at the end. Thank you so much Adrienne you are by far my favorite teacher to follow on YouTube. 🙏🏽💕,Avery Dawn,2020-05-25T20:25:48Z,14

"Love your videos Adriene! The only thing that is constantly a struggle is all the talking while trying to focus through the posture and either clear my mind or just let it be. It distracts my focus or makes my thoughts race more when someone else repeats it over and over to let them go. I also notice that sometimes there&#39;s a lot of talking. For example, we&#39;re on the right side then take 5 breaths, then on the other side it will really by 5 breathes when 16 were put in on the other side. I&#39;ll have to pause the videos a lot and even out which makes these sessions take up more time than I was ready to commit for. I also wish there was some way you could let the videos run for at least 3 minutes in silence at the end to allow the final pose to have its true effect. If I have to get up and pause it, then I lose it my interest in actually doing the final pose and turn it off usually. Thank you for sharing your videos on your channel!",Eileen Hopkins,2020-05-22T14:27:38Z,0

"I happened to come across &#39;Yoga with Adriene&#39; on YouTube several months ago and instantly fell in love! Most of my mornings start with Adriene now! She feels real! She can pick dog hair off her mat without missing a beat, make colloquial references and/or take a few seconds to pet Benji (whom I love to watch!). Adriene is deeply compassionate without taking herself too seriously. I&#39;ve never met her but I already feel a deep kinship with her... or maybe I&#39;m just a silly fan girl who would scream and beg for her autograph, so maybe it&#39;s a good thing I  don&#39;t run into her!😜",Virginie Closson,2020-05-14T14:39:26Z,1

Just enjoyed this one as a morning work break, after almost deciding not to. So glad I did! I have a kitty that while often is lazy, is also really playful at times and one of his favorite “toys” is my yoga mat. So he was having a lot of fun with it too, and only attacked me once 😂.

"My friend showed me yoga July 2019, and ever since i have loved it, i started by watching these videos from Adrian and i just watched a few, i hadn&#39;t been doing it a lot neither have i been doing a lot of poses just ones that i already knew or remembered from before, I&#39;ve recently hurt my lower back about a week ago and I&#39;ve been even more into yoga since, I&#39;ve noticed my back is healing way faster than i had imagined and it feels less strained, I&#39;ve also been able to go without my back brace for a couple hours at a time, I&#39;ve even found myself back at the gym a lot sooner than i thought, and although i still feel pain the yoga has tremendously helped me a lot and for anyone who hasn&#39;t tried it or is scared i truly think you should give it a try, it also has helped me be more spiritual and mentally focused, my depression is better than it has ever been and coming from an over thinker i feel way more at ease and peaceful with my mind and thoughts, i will be following more of your tutorials Adrian thank you so much. &lt;3",starlyn thornquist,2020-03-08T18:07:05Z,7

I&#39;m brand new to yoga, I&#39;ve only done it for about a month and a half, and so I have a hard time completing most yoga sessions - especially if they&#39;re on the long end. But this one was incredible for me! I came to the mat feeling tired, depressed, and unmotivated, and I left feeling much better about life in general, with more energy than I&#39;ve felt in a while. I didn&#39;t even notice the time, I was so into it. I feel amazing right now.

I have noticed that I breath and move with more awareness along the day, not only when I am following your videos. I generally follow everything you do very easily but you always acknowledge that many people might not and I like that you always provide different ways of doing things for those who find it more challenging and help us all to accept ourselves and embrace our own body.

You always make me feel my best, feel my breathing is improving. I worked on this today as realised I don’t always fully breathe in and out. By being more conscious with my breath allowed for more of a flow and extensions in my moves.

"Thanks again for this wonderfully warm, &quot;Yummy&quot; practice. <br /><br />I have a question regarding arms 😂<br />So I have rather long arms (I&#39;m tall) and when it comes to certain positions (like the feet together staring into the pond) my arms end up being awkward and I can&#39;t get the elbows tucked in &amp; forearm straight - always ends up with my elbows wide &amp; arms open.<br /><br />I&#39;ve noticed it in a few positions where my arms should be aligned.<br /><br />Any tips 🤔 thanks.",Neptune TheZimbo,2019-11-24T05:55:55Z,0

"I really enjoyed this practice. I somehow thought because of its title that we&#39;d be doing more of sun salutation asanas, but in fact I was happy to stay low to  the ground, feeling my yoga has my back. I incorporated a little downdog in between the switch from table to cross-legged, finding what my body was craving. It&#39;s good to be able to do so knowing that Adriene would support that little personal adaptation. Find what feels good.

"First time commenting.. been doing the 30 days of yoga. I’m on day 15 halfway through haven’t missed a day. Today was half moon practice and I was falling all over the place but felt so ecstatic with the energies in my body after. That was this morning and I came here for seconds as I wanted an evening session. Yesterday I did two sessions as well, day 14 and another one of the miscellaneous videos. Words can not explain how these practices have made me feel, but one word comes to mind.. Alive. These energies I feel in my body feel wholesome and pure. As an ex football player wrestler rock climber and jiu jitsu practitioner growing up, I’m now 21 almost 22 I’ve suffered a few injuries. I have dislocated both my knees my left knee twice broken my right ankle and torn my rotator cuff in my shoulder as well as broken my toes. These past two weeks I’ve felt a pretty monumental recovery physically and have felt fantastic as well as looking better therefore regaining my confidence physically and mentally. Sorry if this is repetitive, but my bottom line is this is a beautiful practice and community and energy overall and it’s so amazing this is available and out in the world for free above all else. Free.. I’m from the Bay Area where rent is 3000 a month so free is a rare occasion. So stay consistent guys get your gains thank and support Adriene for every video she graces us with and above all else JUST BREATH hahaha!!!!",Nicolas Derksen,2019-11-06T05:37:07Z,0

"Hey Adriene! When I was exercising with my sister this afternoon, I injured my hip. I&#39;ve done my best to stay off it since then, and I know I will have to give up exercise for a few days. I&#39;d hate to give up yoga too, especially if it can help. It&#39;s still hard to put weight on it. So I was wondering if chair yoga is the best thing for me, or if you recommend something else. What is your advice? Thank you!",Madisyn Michele Schuldt,2019-11-04T03:20:58Z,0

This was the first video of yours I’ve watched an I’m in love. Honestly I’ve done yoga at home many times and never have I felt such a peaceful love for myself and so connected to my breath. Your practice reminded me so much to focus on me and my inner self more than the physical aspect and I love that. Now subscribed and can not wait to do more of your classes 💕,Mary Cornish,2019-09-15T06:43:10Z,1

"Just did this video for the first time and I liked it. I just wish there was a way to figure out which videos are best for those who can&#39;t do much with pressure on the wrist (ie table top position and plank). I have a cyst in my left wrist that prevents full extension with pressure. I can do minimal amounts of table top position by using a fist instead, but this video was too long on the wrist action. Any suggestions of which videos would be best for me would be appreciated. Thanks Adriene!",Natasha Vedder,2019-09-14T16:48:15Z,0

Adriene is so pleasant to do yoga with.  Her voice is calming and natural.  She doesn&#39;t try too hard which is so refreshing!!! She also doesn&#39;t feel it necessary to wear provocative clothes to capture her audience.  She is very approachable and down to earth.  So many have an arrogance that turns me off.

"I love the movements. My issue is that I want to keep it moving. I end up pausing to skip her dialogue often. It&#39;s over 20 seconds before each pose can be done which is nice for a beginner but doesn&#39;t help keep a practice and flow. Her little jokes etc are cute but its a bit of an interruption. I&#39;ve seen this across the board with her videos... a little frustrating. Any videos that stay consistent in energy, tone, and breath? Would love to combine your lovely energy and direction with a more steady rhythm to actually make it a practice.",Concetta Morabito,2019-08-31T16:39:57Z,0

"Adriene, your pre and post cardio stretch videos, have, in the past, been instrumental in helping me both FEEL great/build muscle/diminish brain fog/increase energy AND avoid painful nocturnal leg cramps. The stretching, I have proven to myself, aids in my experiencing less back pain/weight-bearing/nerve pain during my cardio, HiiT and walks. Much thanks for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I,  however,  changed up my exercise regime &amp; consequently replaced the daily routine of 50 mins of cardio, concentrating instead upon upon walking and strength training (neglecting your videos and the stretching in the process) and my nocturnal leg cramps have once again become a horrific challenge which frequently interrupt my sleep. Thus far, the nocturnal cramping  has not been avoided with much hydration / the application of topical magnesium chloride flakes in solution / supplements / the topical application of cider vinegar  (which once worked immediately and effectively to instantly un-cramp the muscle in the past), NOR has the ingestion of cider vinegar helped in any noticeable way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             TODAY I did a brief stint of cardio upon awakening (as recommended as an to aid to improving my  sleep quality) and  book-ended the cardio with those two videos (which preface and follow my 160BPM music selection(s))  and I FEEL better than I have in AGES. AGAIN, thanks. I am really focusing on my sleep quality now as so much research stresses the importance of this facet of our daily life as being vital for repair of brain tissue, muscle and for weight loss/weight gain/emotional well being, and health..among other benefits.  Recent sleep research recommends STRETCHING before bed: both to improve the QUALITY of one&#39;s sleep and to avoid those pesky cramps which JOLT me out of sleep. When I stretch WITHOUT your guidance, the process itself is both BORING and not....as relaxing nor beneficial as when i stretch WITH  your instructions....so I ask you, please, WHICH existing video would you suggest as a pre bedtime ritual to aid in improving sleep quality and reducing, perhaps, the severity or frequency of those pesky nocturnal leg (thigh, glute, calf and foot) cramps? ADDITIONALLY, I ask that you, PLEASE, Adriene, consider creating yet another video(s) with the specific yoga YOU FEEL would help we, your legion of HAPPIER, HEALTHIER  novitiates (and those further along the path) which we might  add to our nightly routine to aid with increasing our  sleep quality ? Thank you, should you have the time to respond to this, (or create such content) and thanks, regardless,  for the increased HEALTH and well-being AND MOBILITY I have gained from your tutelage. &quot;Go get &#39;em TIGER&quot; &lt;3",DanceintheRaine666,2019-08-28T20:01:12Z,0

"While I like your humor and commentary, you don&#39;t always speak clearly, which makes it hard to understand you. Maybe look into ways to make it easier to hear what you&#39;re saying (Sound quality may be part of the issue).

"Hi Adriene! I love your videos, I&#39;ve been doing my classes for years and I&#39;m old at Yoga. Today, however, I had a question. I realize that you are super elongated and can get your foot and so on, but in the Butterfly posture, the Baddha Konasana, your legs do not touch the floor. I know stretching is different in each body part for each person, but as it is very easy for me to make the Butterfly and my legs fully touch the floor and yet my chest and my face touch the floor, I&#39;m wondering if you really don&#39;t have this stretch or did not want to demonstrate in the video not to impress your subscribers ?! It remains to be said that I have been practicing for over 14 years and have already taken a course to be a Yoga Instructor, but I did not conclude because I am dedicating myself to another career. Thanks for the attention.",BEATRIZ P. GUIMARÃES ROMERO,2019-08-05T14:59:47Z,2

Usually I&#39;m doing yoga every day but haven&#39;t been doing any during my trip. The day after I came back home, my dad told my mom he wants a divorce. It&#39;s been a turbulent week with so many emotions, and now I finally got the time to get back on the mat. Just to sit down and breathe, being back in my happy place, felt so good.

"Adriene, I have been following you and your videos for several years now. You and your videos are the reason I dove so deep into my at-home practice. Being a person who never really liked practicing in group settings I found your channel to be the perfect outlet for self-care and finding what feels good, and yoga soon became part of my daily routine as a result. <br /><br /><br />Shortly after new years eve this year I was in a pretty bad car accident that left me with a tremendously painful neck injury and a bleak outlook on what the future would hold for me as far as being physically active. After many months of physical therapy and massage, I have just now gained the comfort and confidence to jump back into my practice -- this video being my first step. <br /><br /><br />Thank you for continuing to do what you do for all these years, and for giving me a home to come back to after 7 months of being out of practice. I am no where near the level I once was, but I have never felt more hopeful than I did after this session today. Looking forward to continuing to rebuild my practice with you. Feeling nothing but gratitude.<br /><br /><br />Namaste to you and the entire YWA family across the world.",Marissa Jones,2019-08-03T19:20:20Z,0

"just recently started watching adrienes yoga and I just adore it!<br />I am a competitive athlete and am always looking at hard yoga and the deep stretches, done a few of these with Adriene now and really enjoyed.<br />Feeling particularly tired and hard done by emotionally and physically the last couple of days... stumbled upon this. It was the best treatment I could have been offered! what a lovely gift that was bought to me in such a time of distress!<br />I do actually feel the best I can possibly can be right now!<br />this woman is like the mother of love; her voice, her ways, her persona and aura... so lovely and sweet. a great teacher, not just physically but spiritually too! ...and thats what the others were missing!<br />Thank You!!!",Pookygirl,2019-07-08T19:46:40Z,0
"This video was personally one of my favorites so far along my journey. I&#39;ve been doing Yoga with Adriene for a month now and I know that everyone is different and works at different paces but what was extremely useful and beneficial for me was I started out on a beginners video for the first 2 weeks and did it twice a day every single day for 14 straight days. That helped me get extremely comfortable with the poses and from there I began slowly trying some of the other videos. I recently just began to 30 day challenge videos and tomorrow I will be on day 4 and in my opinion yoga and Adriene both ROCK, lol. Anyway I hope that my little bit of advice will help someone else who is wanting to do this so badly but doesn&#39;t know where to begin. Peace and love people!!!<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YOGAFAMILY"">#YOGAFAMILY</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NAMASTE"">#NAMASTE</a>",Christopher Simcik,2019-07-08T18:52:50Z,0

Don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m respecting it, and making the best of this situation. So this time, that won&#39;t &quot;come in the way&quot; and take my limited energy from me.

"Ive done that position plenty of times since i first started doing yoga ten years ago. Rarely gave it much attention. Re-cast as the &quot;zoolander&quot; its now my favorite and I&#39;ll be adding it to the end of every session. Absolutely love your videos, wouldnt have been able to sustain my job as a massage therapist without them. One suggestion in two parts: At the end of the titles of your videos you could put 2 or 3 &quot;scales&quot; for the pace (maybe the intensity as well) and how much space the routine requires. Sometimes I get to one of your Texas T&#39;s and I have to get up and move some small furniture about to keep going. ...also maybe a video for massage therapists! : )",michael garcia,2019-06-30T19:21:55Z,0

I did this whilst feeling sluggish last week and I did it again today whilst feeling very energetic. This was such a different experience for me that the only thing that made me realize it was the same practice was a line you said that I remembered I have heard before.<br />Moral of the story: Try each yoga session more than once &amp; while experiencing different moods! So surprising 🧡🧡,anna k,2019-06-04T17:32:44Z,0

But my husband reminded me that every time I don&#39;t feel well and do the practice anyway, I always feel better after. Of course he was right. Halfway through I realized my headache was gone, and also maybe what I&#39;ve always thought was a dehydration headache after running was actually because my back was so tight?

"Felt SO good! Thank you for your commitment and generosity, Adriene and Benji and Chris  :) ❤️🙏 <br /><br /><br />PS In the past, I started yoga classes many times, but, even though I&#39;m grateful, it was always about working &#39;on&#39; (not with!) the body for &#39;the right posture&#39;, which felt more strenuous than relaxing - and, you returned home with a sense of &#39;not there yet&#39;, &#39;not good enough yet&#39; (lack). <br /><br /><br />... while You have us focused on Find What Feels Good and that wherever we&#39;re at is already &#39;being there&#39;, &#39;being good enough/perfect&#39;, and - surprise! - the yoga poses are better than ever, as a side-effect, AND you help transform the inner narrative in millions of people around the globe. It helps ground and (re)align us with our Love-filled Spirit. Adriene, Benji, and Chris, You&#39;re three of the leading peacemakers of this time, just by being who you are and doing what you love, co-creating in that - and sharing it with us.

"Honestly your videos give me so much strength and I wanna thank you for that. I&#39;m struggling with depression and anxiety a lot so it&#39;s really hard to keep me motivated, but just knowing that <b>you</b> would guide me through this, helps me feeling better already. You&#39;re such a lovely angel and your videos do so much for me that I honestly am close to tears because it takes so much pressure off of me. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll even read this but I truly wanna thank you. I only recently started doing yoga so I&#39;m ready to see and feel how much more it can benefit my mental health if I actually continue doing it regularly, which I definitely will at some point. So again, thank you so much, you really help a lot of people with this and no matter if you believe in karma or not, but I so wish all this will give you enough good karma to have a life that you can enjoy to the fullest, you only deserve the best.

I got back to YWA after many many days of staying away from the mat.

My previous experience to yoga is limited to once a week for a this past fall semester when I was accompanying a friend to her yoga class. I am very pleased with the progress I have been making in my flexibility, poster, body awareness, and recovery from weight lifting. I use yoga typically on my off days from the gym as a form of recovery. Very creative and fun videos. Your positivity keeps me coming back. Keep up the great work.",Stephen Dunker,2019-05-03T17:34:18Z,0

I almost feel like crying everytime I hear your voice on a yoga session or get an email from you, because you&#39;ve become a very powerful symbol to me saying; it&#39;s ok to relax, it&#39;s ok to take time for yourself. Before I was so ashamed even thinking in that way. Can&#39;t even express it to you. Me and my two cats are &quot;with you&quot; every single day on the mat.

"For the whole winter I did yoga every day. I was in a bit of a slump in November and from December through March I maybe missed four days. I started with one of your 30 day challenges having done a fair amount of yoga but not a daily practice. I felt AMAZING! I had so much love and joy and graceful movement. This past month of April however, I have not been so dedicated to myself. I have slacked off in many healthy and loving aspects of my life and I have felt its toll. Today, May 2nd I showed up on my mat with your help and welcomed back in that love, joy and gratitude. My mantra for today was I choose graceful movement, and my mantra for the whole year is Graceful Acceptance, of myself, others, and daily life. You have helped me in many ways and although we do not know each other we both share a love of many things including: Austin, Barton Springs, Breakfast tacos, and loving ourselves and others.

The knots in my body literally gave way and my mind feels so much more fresh. I even had a good cry in between and can&#39;t describe how awesome this was for me.

I have problematic knees and also like practices that are a little more sweaty (whey!) but like to stay in the flow so it&#39;d be nice to know roughly what&#39;s in store?

"You asked to let you know how this session helped - I started this video in a seated cross-legged position, and usually my right foot goes in front. Today, I was having pain in my right knee in that position, so I switched to left foot in front. At the end of the video, I absent-mindedly put my right foot in front - and then noticed that I had no knee pain in that position. <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying yoga is the cure-all, just giving my testimonial about where I was when I started, and where I was 20 minutes later, in a specific pose. I still have pain elsewhere, but I&#39;m feeling much more fluid and moveable and <b>less</b> pain. Better, not perfect, is my goal. <br /><br />Also, thanks for being a part of my self-care routine. I&#39;ve gotten a lot out of having you as an instructor (via YouTube) over the last few years. I will often catch myself, when I&#39;m just standing, parting attention to my feet and if I&#39;m standing on all four corners of my feet. I am learning to accept myself and my limitations and meet myself there instead of judging myself because I can&#39;t do what someone else is doing. I&#39;m not them! I&#39;m <b>me*, and this is where *I</b> am. What I have learned from you goes far beyond the mat. Thank you.",Julia Dillenbeck,2019-04-28T14:02:55Z,2

I’ve been so stressed 😥 lately, so much so that I’m holding it in and is very tense 😬 and tight. So I came to what I know when I need a healthy way to “let go”. It was very difficult, however I feel much better getting off the mat than I did when I got on it. I’m going to try very hard to keep coming back as I know it is really good for me.

"Hi! I am really enjoying your video&#39;s and trying to find myself a play list with a few video&#39;s that work best for my body. And I think I heard you ask for ideas for new video&#39;s. So here is one! And some context! I have pain issues, fibromyalgie and have noticed that it helps if I do some exercises regularly during the day, with a max of 25 minutes (so far).  <br /><br />Today I am having a bad day but stubborn as I am, I tried your video of Total body yoga - Deep Core. So, yeah, did not get far with that :P But I do not give up! After that I did Yoga for hips &amp; Lower back release, which did not do much but I could finish! So then I just finished with Yoga for flexibility, which turned out to be just what I needed! <br /><br />And all of that searching made me think, maybe you could do a few daily routines, like the dedicate video&#39;s but cut them up. So in the morning you have a nice stretch like the Yoga for the feet and yoga for flexibility, around lunchtime something that takes a bit more power and warming you up and in the evening a cooling down and digestion, or a different order if that is better/healthier.",rodepet,2019-04-26T14:11:20Z,0

What a massive crash course in a deeper reverence and humility for the gift of life and health and the ability to move! <br /><br />YWA was <b>exactly</b> the place I knew intuitively I needed to come to find some soothing self-compassion and ease as I slowly slip back into recultivating my movement practice.<br /><br />Loved this.

"Hi Adriene!  I love your work and you are truly an inspiration to me, and obviously millions of others.     I share your name and preach the good word of yoga and daily practice to everyone who will listen.  Its always fun and exciting when I talk to a friend or stranger who also follows you which happens quite often!  So with all this being said I have a weird and technical question:  What kind of mic pack do you use?  <br />I&#39;m an independent filmmaker and freelance videographer who currently has a chance to book a big client who teaches prenatal workout routines and wants video content.  The format will be different from yours, but one thing that will need to be the same is quality audio which you and your team have always done beautifully.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to practicing with you soon.  <br />Namaste!",EM 3,2019-04-22T17:20:58Z,0

Children really are the best. ....but just for the record, unbeknownsted to me, my dad already did yoga back in the early 80ies. He used it to get rid of migraine and stress. He then dropped it, but it&#39;s cool to see how some things, over a generation or two ( or a few more...) develop in a good way.

"I&#39;m now convinced that Benji is a cat. He&#39;s consistently been quiet and curled up nearby, and occasionally in the way. Today he made the case even stronger by watching you curiously as you made noise and walking off to sleep somewhere more quiet, and to cap it all off, when he was grabbed in a hug he just walked faster. Such a fun companion for these videos.",Kerico,2019-04-22T06:04:37Z,0

"I&#39;ve been feeling really negative, angry and scared lately. It&#39;s just a weird time for me, I&#39;ve been buried in work, became annoyed with most of my friends. Been shutting myself out and feeling really sensitive. I always tended to be someone who liked people and talking to them but somehow lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I can&#39;t connect and share with anyone because everyone is just wrapped up in their own drama and not interested in listening as much as talking. Everything just began feeling pointless to me. It&#39;s not like I stopped liking people or being kind to them, I just have been (secretly) nurturing this feeling of pointlessness and lack of hope. And all this negativity has been really weighing on me. Where I wanted to get with all of this is to the fact about yoga that made me come back to the mat today, the fact that it is a moment to be at the same time brutally and kindly honest with yourself. And that&#39;s why that moment in this practice when you compared it to &quot;staring into a pond and looking at your own reflection&quot; was so emotional for me. I felt so sad and scared while &quot;looking&quot; at my own reflection. I was faced with this abstract feeling that I can&#39;t connect with anyone, not even myself and that I&#39;m so terrified of what the future holds. So terrified that it will be somehow disappointing, that I&#39;l disappoint my self, that the world will feel disappointing. I am so scared of feeling pointless. But, after facing that, I feel a little, faint, spark of hope. I feel like I began (once again) healing, and that if I keep approaching this practice with honesty I may be able to, maybe, at some point, actually become the change I wanna see in the world instead of just feeling so negative and powerless. So thank you for giving me a path Adriene, it means more than you&#39;ll ever know.",Tathiana Abreu,2019-04-21T23:55:16Z,0

"Really yummy practice! 🤤 I&#39;ve been practicing with you since 2014 and it really has been (still is) the best thing I can do in my day, I love your practices because they really help me feel good in my body (so comfortable and nice) and also emotionally. However, a month ago my boyfriend of 5 years and I broke up and ever since I&#39;ve been feeling like I&#39;ve got a dagger in my upper back, right between my shoulders. I&#39;m used to this kind of muscle pain because I&#39;m constantly working on a desk, normally I would practice yoga and I would feel incredible relief and the pain would go away. But right now I feel like I&#39;m storing all the emotional bag (it&#39;s really big, I&#39;ve been feeling really sad) from the break up and its aftermath there in that spot, I haven&#39;t been sleeping very well and even though I&#39;ve been constant with the yoga practice, the pain there doesn&#39;t seem to relief at all... Sorry for the life story, Adriene, I actually just wanted to ask if you could do a practice to relief the pain in that spot I mentioned remixed or mixed up with a 2nd version of the yoga for a broken heart ? ❤️ I really am thankful for you and this channel! 🥰",amuci11,2019-04-21T17:37:54Z,0

Thank you for your positive energy and sharing it with the world. I started crying in the middle of today&#39;s session because I have immense emotional pain and when you come to the yoga mat you face yourself. I ended in peace because at the end of the day yoga is calming for my soul.

I’m closing in on 59 and I never thought I’d be able to do that. Thank you for giving me this magic that is yoga every day. Un abrazo fuerte. ❤️",Raechel McGhee,2019-04-21T11:25:23Z,0

Hi Adriene. Thanks for this. I am feeling little shaken up from some things this weekend and lately for a couple of weeks I have had lower energy where things that came easy for me just don’t and it hurts to “overdo” it. I made it through. Have a nice day. 🌈❤️,Leah Kelley,2019-04-21T11:12:14Z,2

"I have ME so can really only do seated and supine yoga, I did the first 7 minutes of this in bed and it was so lovely. I love your approach and so I cherry pick the bits of your videos that I can do. This works for me better than following some of the videos I see that are supposedly aimed at people with ME but are just too much. Plus your voice and energy are just so gorgeous, you always make me smile. Thank you.",myrtle keyhole,2019-04-21T11:12:05Z,0

By then I was in Ghana with my family,mostly the time not having a room to myself yetmanaging to fond the time and the space to practise yoga, which helped me to find private time for me. Right now I am travelling in nz, using yoga to help me cope with the constant changes of my environment - I slept on a different hostel every day for this week and practiced every day! It is not about your circumstances, it is about your engagement in finding what you need. I don&#39;t even have a Matt 😂 my first one ever is waiting for me at home.

Yay i&#39;m now starting to feel better just from having received the notification for this new Sunday practice despite having been bed ridden the past week with a cold. Summer vibes are kickin&#39; in out here everyone. Thank you Adriene for the positivity you&#39;ve brought to my day once again. You have truly become a light in the dark for me as well as many others. Keep the positive energy flowing as well as changing lives for the better. Much love. Namaste.,Shadan Zahrooni,2019-04-21T05:11:17Z,5
"Adrienne, I just want you to know that you make me feel my best every day that I practice with you! ♥️ I’m so grateful to have YWA in my life - I started with dedicate on Jan 2nd and haven’t stopped since 💪🏽",Oveeya Vendon,2019-04-21T05:05:39Z,259

Exactly the same. A dog walking friend recommended YWA to me in January. And after Dedicate I have missed maybe 10 days due to travelling or other lame reasons. Thank you Adriene the two best things about this is how professional you are and how varied the practice is. Thank you for making it free. I watch all the ads and hope you earn a nice big crust!,Line Page,2019-04-22T13:31:26Z,0
