"This sequence is an absolute favorite of mine. I started doing yoga at home (and found Adriene shortly after) around the time I started seeing a nutritionist for eating disorder recovery. I didn&#39;t intend for yoga to become a part of my recovery-- I just wanted a way to stay active during quarantine. It wasn&#39;t until I started doing videos with Adriene every day that I realized just how much my eating disorder and PTSD head kept me from existing in, experiencing, and connecting with my own body. Videos like these are so accessible (in so many ways! physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually), meeting me where I am while also gently encouraging me to push past my perceived limits. I genuinely love my body for the first time in my life-- not because it looks good, but because it is strong and powerful and capable of so much. I still struggle with feeling too aware in my body but yoga has become key to overcoming the fear and trauma associated with my body, and I&#39;m so thankful for this online community for helping me do what years of therapy couldn&#39;t.",Annabeth Mellon,2020-11-09T12:53:45Z,2

"I wish I had read the comments first. I desperately needed something light that would NOT make me sweat today. Feel this was mis-labeled - to me “getting to know” your body means taking your time. I have been doing yoga every day for years, but I still need time for transitions and this was way too fast. I could I let get ten minutes in and will have to find something else to undo the knots from this. Just wish the high intensity ones came with clearer warnings instead of the other way around. I personally am never interested in working out or sweating when I do yoga.",Nicole Lopez-Hagan,2020-09-27T01:22:44Z,0

"This was great! I&#39;ve been trying to get back into exercising after having some hip problems, and I&#39;m always so pleasantly surprised because my hip feels so much better after I do yoga. :) Also this is by far the most I&#39;ve ever succesfully done downward facing dog! I realized last time I did yoga that my elbows are weird and whenever I&#39;ve attempted downward facing dog in the past my elbows hurt, but I think it&#39;s because my inner elbows were facing up. Not sure how I manage to do that (like I said, my elbows are weird!!) but I made a point to have my inner elbows pointed towards my body this time instead of up and it was MUCH easier!",butterfly17095,2020-01-18T19:21:56Z,0

"On these eve of thanks or gratitude I would like to extend my sincere thanks to you. I was studying to become a personal trainer when I got rear ended, resulting in a herniated disc in my cervical spine. Unable to go back to my regular routine I started practicing here with you. Leading me to a studio, a life changing practice, and a passion so big I made it my life’s work. I am now a yoga teacher who focuses on accessibility, safety, mobility, and empowering others to connect and feel good in their body. I have had many teachers along my journey but all great journeys start with a first step and that my friend is you. And now I understand how crucial that first or first few experiences with yoga and a teacher can be. So very grateful for you, your light, and all that you share!",Dennisse Morales,2019-11-28T08:36:44Z,3

"Needed this today and decided to try and do it with my eyes closed to see if it helped me to notice better how my body felt. Managed most of it but lost balance in the twist but instead of stressing, as I often do when I can`t do something, it made me giggle and I simply opened my eyes for that bit. I thank you Adriene for my ability to no longer worry about how I look but enjoy how I feel in the poses and for realising that it`s no biggy if today I am not as `good` as yesterday and to know that tomorrow will be different again. I look forward to what tomorrow will bring. Namaste.",tracy whalley,2019-11-23T18:56:59Z,0

"HELLO Adriene!!! I want to thank you for this video and all the videos you provide for us. I started school early September and I got caught up with everything I had to do and have to do. I totally neglected my body and, more importantly, my mental health. Over the past two weeks, my back started to hurt, my hips became tight, and my jaw was always clenching. The neglect of my body and mind started to leak into my school work and social life. The video was a wonderful reminder to take care of the body and mind. I was starting to get lost into the cycle of self-neglect, indulgence and procrastination, but this video grounded me. As of right now, I have clarity and peace of mind to focus. Thank you Adrienne! I plan to ace this semester with your help!!! Again thank you so much! Much love and appreciation!",Zahra Hussain,2019-09-21T23:09:23Z,0

"Hey Adrienne, I had to take a break because I fractured my back.  I am back now starting slow.  My surgeon said the worse thing a person with lumbar spine issues is cobra or anything the involves reverse hyper extending the back.  It&#39;s probably what caused the fractures.  I think it would be great if you said it&#39;s not good for people with spinal stenosis disc degenerative disease herniated disc...

"Suggestion: &quot;Yoga for recovery from laproscopic tummy surgery&quot;. With both my gastric bypass and gall bladder surgeries, I was told to keep moving to avoid clots and speed recovery. Problem was that my mobility and energy were compromised due to obesity and having just had surgery. Also, I was told to take care not to strain my healing tummy muscles. A 10 to 15 minute video, with little strain (just lying down or just standing up - or one of each) and easy on the stomach muscles, would be great!",D Hill,2019-09-01T03:31:17Z,0

I usually do yoga for deep stretch recovery because I mainly do powerlifting but this is my first time trying out this kind of yoga.

Getting to outside classes is difficult and frankly I can&#39;t afford it. I also have a dog named Otis who prefers to be with me as much as dogly possible. You are part of my healing journey of the last 5 years. I am so very grateful for your time, your teaching, your silly side and your shared love of yoga. I can say now, finally, at the age of 60, that I have a regular daily in home yoga practice because of you. I&#39;m finally even comfortable to do yoga on my own without a guide. I do still prefer that though. And I can now keep up with you! Blessings to you, Benji (Otis says woof), your family and all the budding yogis and yoginis here.

"Hello, Adriene! I started doing yoga 4 years ago and got really into it but then I got really sick and almost bedbound for a year. Unfortunately, it really affected my general body tone and my state of mind in a bad way. Two months ago, in June, I had a surgery that fixes my condition. The recovery has been slow but sure so now I&#39;m finally allowed to get back to yoga. It&#39;ll take some time to reconnect with my body after such a harsh year, not expecting any quick results or dramatic changes but that&#39;s fine.<br />I&#39;m just truly thankful for all your wonderful thoughts and practices. You saved my life.<br /><br />I live in Russia and it&#39;s insanely hot here in August, it&#39;s about 36 C. Can you make a video for hot weather please? Or some tips for practicing in hot weather?",lunacy fringe,2019-08-19T20:16:29Z,0

"I truly loved this yoga session! Since I stopped taking hormonal contraception, I&#39;ve been waiting for weeks and weeks to get my period back. Maybe reuniting with my body will help to reunite with my natural cycle as well, I really really hope so. Do you think it would be possible to help your natural cycle flow with yoga?

"Hi Adriene, I have been a fan of yours for some time now and totally loved doing your videos. However, I have degenerative disc disease, and recently had a discectomy for an extremely painful herniated disc. I would LOOOOVE to get back to yoga, but was told NO FORWARD FOLDING!!!! In fact, no spinal flexion of any kind, but spinal extension is good for my back. Can you consider making a series of videos for folks with herniated discs, that will strengthen the muscles supporting the spine without any poses that require flexion? I know it’s a tall order, but I miss your videos so much!!!  I want to find what feels good!!",Stacey Michael,2019-08-18T14:35:49Z,0

Getting back on the mat today, after I&#39;ve read the topic &quot;Reunite with your body&quot; in your newsletter, was healing for me. I almost cried and my baby was next to my mat, playing with his activity center but also been totally amazed by the way his mom moved and breathed and smiled - because I started to feel like myself again.

Boy have I been craving for some love through some gentle yoga practice to start this whimsical Sunday morning. This is truly relaxing to wake up on a Sunday knowing that our pal Adriene is gonna have a new magical practice popping up in our feed in just minutes from the time we drag ourselves out of bed. Thank you Adriene for reminding us to love our body and self no matter the adversity that is to be withstood. We are worthy everyone! Time to reunite with our one and only body and show it some love. You guys rock!! Much love. Namaste.,Shadan Zahrooni,2019-08-18T05:10:47Z,137
