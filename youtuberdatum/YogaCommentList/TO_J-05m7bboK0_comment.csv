"I went to my Dr to ask about what I could do for a pretty seized muscle that feels rock hard and not in the good way from gym training, she suggested yoga so here I am, a little skeptical before I did this as I thought yoga was overglorified stretching but I truly believe after 2 videos it&#39;s so much more than that, I feel like I doubled up mindfulness meditation with amazing stretching. Will be doing this for now on, i can&#39;t wait to see how far I come in the next month, year, decade! Thank you for your amazing video and just reminding me how much this restores my mindful capabilities, and my bodies connection with itself.",Jakey,2021-04-09T09:10:15Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I adore you &amp; often during practice wander off in my mind, dreaming of our future happy life together. Unfortunately I&#39;m not a particularly great catch. I&#39;m an old fart who foolishly tends to over exert himself by lifting heavy stuff - which brought me to this video. What a brilliant addition to your output on Back Love -- simple, basic and extremely rewarding, especially for existing pain. You must be so proud of all the great work you&#39;ve complied so far! <br /><br />I was enjoying the stretches so much that I paused the video here and there for en extra couple of minutes, feeling the problem areas in my back, from hips to shoulders, and breathing into them. It felt great. I do have to be careful though, not to go for too long or take it too far - for example, I stayed cross legged for a while, enjoying the forward leaning stretch, not paying attention to my lower body, then experienced the pain coming out: cramped muscles &amp; hurting joints. I had to rest, stretch my legs out, point &amp; flex my feet, circle my ankles before I could switch to the other side. I then proceeded gingerly to the end of the video. Can&#39;t wait to try it again tomorrow. This one is a keeper!<br /><br />Thank you for your wonderful gift.<br /><br />Namaste",Yuval,2021-02-04T19:51:52Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I regularly practice yoga with your help. Thank you for all the videos. I have scoliosis, and I am 51 years. I would like more practices that would strengthen my back and stomach muscles. I don’t have back pain, only aches. I can’t do the half sit ups in which I turn and hold without injuring myself,  and balance poses are hard since my balance is off. I wondered if you could target these weaknesses without using the poses I mentioned.  I especially like downward dog and calf-cow. All of these have kept me pain free this long, but as I age I have noticed that my core is losing muscle seemingly overnight. My daughter also has scoliosis, and I know many others with this genetic problem. I think we could benefit greatly from specific yoga practices for us. Thanks so much!",Susan Blower,2020-12-31T18:48:26Z,0

Thank you so much for this. I&#39;m 34 and after years of having a hyper-mobile lower back that I didn&#39;t support enough (I do ballet recreationally and didn&#39;t put enough focus on developing core muscles to support my arabesque etc) I threw my back out last year. Since then I have occasionally back-spasms and I have to be extra careful about how I stand and sleep. I hardly do anything to the back in ballet these days in an effort to not trigger the pain. This was extremely soothing and I feel like my spine is lined up better now. I&#39;ll be coming back to this one!,jankoraven,2020-12-27T23:14:17Z,0

"I really enjoy your yoga videos. It seems like there is literally a video for everyone, every level, and to fit every mood and need. The instruction is easy to follow and understand. You have a calming presence. I have told all of my friends about your channel and have suggested they try it and I have even challenged a few to do it with me. I&#39;ve been back consistently since stumbling upon your channel several months ago. I never thought I&#39;d be that person who does youtube yoga videos, but here I am and loving it. <br /><br />It would be helpful to know how to alter movements when they require bended knees such as sitting crossed legged or sitting on heels such as what was done in this video - have bad knees. <br /><br />Thank you so much.",Gail W,2020-10-26T03:34:23Z,0
"Ok so we all didn&#39;t realize we&#39;d need a blanket/towel and figured we didn&#39;t need one, then we saw that clearly, we did need one and absolutely DIED laughing at ourselves trying to fold our yoga mats, and then the move where one leg was bent was NOT working for me so I just laid flat on the floor and we got a good laugh out of that. I don&#39;t think this practice was meant to be so funny, but I&#39;m glad that that&#39;s what happened, we all needed it :)",Sophia Sherrill,2020-10-26T00:40:52Z,0

I just had a sudden breakdown crying when I went into the pose in this video where she had us lie with the blanket under one hip just before where we draw our knee up and out to the side. I cried a lot. It felt like the most amazing release. It may have been partly relief from constant low back and left hip pain, but it felt like much more.

"Yoga, or more to the point, Adriene has been my saviour. That may sound dramatic to some people, but I&#39;m confident my fellow yogis can relate. Since having a hip injury back in June this year, I&#39;ve not been able to run. But I&#39;ve always stuck to yoga daily and thrown in the odd strength training here and there. Lately I&#39;ve been experiencing lower back pain and instead of going to an osteopath, I persevered with yoga and the discomfort has subsided dramatically 🙌<br /><br />Not only has yoga helped my body in more ways than I EVER thought possible, but it is supporting my spiritual journey too. My mind feels calmer and there&#39;s less noise. I&#39;m able to use my breathing to benefit sleep, moments of panic or stress and it&#39;s now having an amazing impact on my family. <br /><br />My son has ADHD and he&#39;s seeing how dedicated I am to these practices and how it benefits me. So now he joins in too. <br /><br />When those around us see how it impacts us, they want a piece of the pie too.<br /><br />Namaste 🙏💛",Clare Cavalli,2020-09-27T17:55:48Z,0

I do it every morning in combination with one other video from your channel (I am working through them as this is my first yoga journey) and I must say, I have been virtually pain free for most of my day since starting day one.  I have recommended your videos to a friend that suffers from similar pain (she cannot do the kneeling poses maybe an idea for another video???). I look forward to continuing my journey, namaste. btw. Benji is adorable.",Jennifer Wagner,2020-09-16T02:37:42Z,0
"Just coming back to Yoga and training after a back injury and the flow of this video is perfect. Always enjoy following you.<br /><br />Was wondering if you could post a short PRE and/or POST workout warm up / cool-down video, with specific movements that could help someone with past back injury each day in their training. <br />I have some exercises from Physio but always enjoy some Yoga as my warm up and cooldown before I train, so was hoping for something to focus on prevention really :)<br /><br />Lauren from Ireland.<br />I love your channel :D",Lauren Duffy,2020-09-15T15:58:01Z,0

"Hi Adriene, thanks for your encouraging words and workouts.  It would be great if we had some ideas of what to do if we cannot bend knees much.  I usually just sit with my legs in a V when I cannot bend them enough so some cues on what to do would be great.  I have had surgery so I can bend them but not as much as needed for criss cross apple sauce or child&#39;s pose.  Thanks!

"Adrienne, I found your videos a couple of years ago and so began my journey to becoming more in tune with my body and leading a more relaxed life. Beginning my day with your videos sets me up for a day where I feel more in control and attuned to myself and my surroundings. I don&#39;t just feel like I am watching a yoga video, I feel like I am a part of a spiritual journey into body awareness and confidence.<br />I am a 25 year old Early Childhood Teacher (0-5 years) and I am constantly up and down with children. I injured my back pretty badly last year and after weekly physio sessions for a year, I began engaging with your videos again. Even though some of the poses in the video were similar to my physio stretches, I felt a million times better after your session than I did with any physio exercise. Thank you Adrienne, Namaste from New Zealand.",Courtney Mcdonald,2020-09-02T21:35:25Z,0

"Hey Adrienne I stumbled on your channel as if it was a sign from God to help with the issues ive been having with my body. Before your yoga helped me I had an overextended left leg from putting my body in an extreme position and over a year I was walking this way. About a week ago I was able to essentially shift everything back into place specifically when I placed my right hip towards the left side of my mat and allowed my crossed legs to fall. I literally felt my spine and heard it go back to normal. Since then I have discovered on top of plantar fasciitis that my hips are EXTREMELY tight from years of poor posture and sway back due to plantars feet. Your practice and a posture corrector has really helped but I was wondering what would you recommend to seriously loosen my hips a lot more? I&#39;m unable to even get pass criss cross applesauce with my knees at a 35° angle. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=25m23s"">25:23</a> i couldn&#39;t even attempt the position without a small sting pain im my right knee, I&#39;m also knock-kneed and have been correcting it consciously for a few years. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=12m56s"">12:56</a> my body wasn&#39;t allowing me to perform the full stretch and had me sorta stuck at my gut half way reaching the stretch. Outside of my body being very rigid Thank You for being an amazing first experience into yoga. I love what you do and i tell everyone i know about Yoga with Adrienne.",K J,2020-08-18T01:57:26Z,0

"Hello Dear Adriene! I recently retired, and started doing daily Yoga with you. My thirty-year -old daughter, Clare, started at the same time, and we try to stay in sync with each other. We both did 30 days of Yoga and 28 days of Yoga camp, then I hurt my sacroiliac, so I&#39;ve turned to gentle lower back videos. So great-all of them! Clare and I love them and love your sweet, gentle, friendly and humorous (isn&#39;t that the funny bone?) ways! We also love Benji, of course. BTW my sacroiliac is beginning to feel much better!<br /><br />The silver lining of Covid isolating is we begin to discover things we can do as an on-line community, and ways we can find that sense of community on the internet. I feel as if I&#39;ve found a new friend in you, and I know Clare feels the same way. You help build health bodies and spirits! Thank you!<br /><br />Russ in Tucson",Russ Healy,2020-07-17T00:01:39Z,0

OK this is my 4th day following along with your videos. Not even kidding on day one my legs were so tight and I had such an extreme lack of joint rotation I could barely even sit cross legged. I have beaten my body up for the last 4 years as a competitive power lifter and I swear to god this is the best my body has felt in the last 4 years. I can sit cross legged with ease and am starting to really be able to move my body in ways I haven&#39;t been able to in ages and its only been 4 days !!!!

I’ve been extremely frustrated with my body lately, and I don’t know of a way to continue doing yoga without wanting to rip my hair out at this time. I know I should accept where I’m at, appreciate that it’s all connected, etc, but that doesn’t always work when every movement is painful, simply breathing hurts my chest, and my shoulders are mindlessly always tensed.

"Thank you so much for this! I&#39;ve been doing some strength training lately, and I&#39;m not the best at engaging my core muscles when doing different exercises, so when I&#39;m done, I definitely feel it in my lower back. I did this yoga routine right after my strength training this morning, and I could feel the difference as soon as I was done. I&#39;ll definitely come back to this workout frequently. Thank you so much Adriene! I absolutely love your peaceful, gentle and mindful approach to yoga and health. You&#39;re an angel! &lt;3",Guiding Echoes,2020-04-28T15:40:25Z,100

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga with you for over a year now, and should have commented long ago. Your warmth, humor, sincerity, and oh yeah- the yoga- have been life altering for me and I have such deep gratitude. I am a homesick Texan in NYC and every Texas reference and your accent/words are so comforting. The stress of the Covid crisis has gone to my lower back and during the last child pose, I had tears streaming down my face, still do. Not from physical pain, but all the sadness for lives, lost, worry, just poured out when I took that last deep breath. Beautiful things are also happening during this time as well and I have much hope and even joy in certain moments. Thank you Adriene, your videos are much needed medicine every day but especially now. I am a paying member but actually use the free stuff anyway.

So what you did at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=10m07s"">10:07</a>, I just can&#39;t do that without  impossible strain on my lower back, so my abdominals just aren&#39;t doing anything, and I don&#39;t know how to kick them into action.

"I&#39;ve been racking my brain on how to show my appreciation for your channel without being sentimental and cheesy, but I dont think there is a way to accomplish that goal. When I was 14 I was in a car accident with massive injuries including crushing my L2 vertebrae and multiple breaks in both femurs. Then two years ago my back started to fail me and no doctor would touch my back because of all the hardware. They decide to treat my pain instead of fixing my back. I lost everything from my back failing even was forced to quit my job. My days were full of numbing the pain with pain pills and drinking to battle the depression. Then watching the joe Rogan experience with ddp inspired me to try yoga. All respect to ddp and his product and what he is doing but I wasnt able to do his routines, which broke my spirits. I almost had given up until one fateful day in October I stumbled onto your video, yoga for beginners. What sets you a part for me is how you advise adjustment for every position, your tempo allows me to adjust myself so I can perform the position correctly before moving to the next, and how your routines are custom built to strengthen specific muscle instead of just full body routines. Since then your channel has been inserted into my daily routine. I went from not even being able to stand or sit straight up for more than hour at a time to as of yesterday jogging/walking for 3 miles. You&#39;ve help me regain my feeling of worth and the back strength to live life again. Thank you",The Creecher,2020-04-11T15:33:20Z,0

"I&#39;ve been suffering with awful tension around my rib cage and lower back.  I&#39;ve always been sceptical about yoga , as I tried it when I was around 18 and wasn&#39;t impressed.  However I&#39;m so glad I found this video!, I started doing this routine a few days ago and I love it!  I can really feel the tension easing.  I love the way this lady presents it, so relaxed, no pressure,  the dog is a nice addition too.   At first I thought she was a bit annoying but she actually has a lovely way about her.   I&#39;m going to share this with my mum who suffers so many aches and pains and try and encourage her to do it.",hanna presenting,2020-04-02T06:38:31Z,0
"Thank you Adriene, for another great video.  My back has been hurting since I started working from home (as many Americans and others worldwide are all, as you know, working from home because of COVID-19), and the video was awesome. I will probably do it again tomorrow night. I think I actually take more breaks at work and get up from my chair more at the office than at home, so I am siting for longer and longer periods.",Psilon6,2020-04-02T03:43:43Z,0

Bringing your knees to the chest as well as twisting the knees to the side is the worst thing you can do for back pain. Yes it feels good because it activates the stretch receptors and you get a little rush but long term it is very bad. Twisting and bending the spine isn&#39;t good for back pain.,Ryan Pugh,2020-02-18T17:39:02Z,0

"This one was so bittersweet for me. My senior kitty is getting ready to cross the rainbow bridge. We are keeping her warm and comfortable, as any type of intervention would not do anything but make her miserable and artificially sustain a life that has been very well-lived. She will likely not make it through the night, but if she does, we will have someone come in the morning to help her cross that bridge into kitty nirvana. This practice was full of emotion for me, but I also needed the lower back love today. Now I can put even more love into my kitty&#39;s final moments here ❤️ She&#39;s been with me since I first moved out of my parent&#39;s home. Nearly 20 yrs. She will always be my sweet, sweet girl.",Kelly,2020-02-14T04:44:48Z,3

"13.02.2020. KISS Yoga. <br />I have been doing Yoga for sometime now mostly Sundays as my active rest day and squeezing a class here and there when I had time. Last year I decided to try the 30 day Yoga by Adriene daily. I loved it. I realised that I actually can make time for it. But I stopped there. The rest of the year was back to Sundays and a class here and there. This year I was ready for it coz I have realised I have become stronger, it shows alot when working out as a result of Yoga. I guess I even listened more. There&#39;s always a constant message from Adriene: gratitude   appreciating ourselves, spreading love, smiling...all positive stuff... I decided to take the message with me and am enjoying everything. I have learned to be grateful. What&#39;s even better I love myself more. I look at the mirror and I appreciate my body and who I am. Not always   I need to loose weight here, I need to do this...NOT ANYMORE. I appreciate this far I have come and look forward to where am going. If I slip and fall I tell my body, well you tried,  let&#39;s do this next time. Thanks Adriene. Am a happier person now all around: family,  work, strangers...be blessed. 😘",Jenky sikolia,2020-02-13T20:13:39Z,2

Adriene- You are totally changing my life! I have practiced with you daily this year. I normally start my day with you. It’s a wonderful way to gently and lovingly ease into the day. After 12 years of hitting the gym first thing - at 5 am- my body is exhausted. I’m learning to find new flow and balance my energy. I’m enormously grateful for you. And I absolutely love Benji. You are a game changer and a wonderful spirit so needed in this world. I’m 62 with a new found passion for yoga because of you.

"The title suits the video so well! I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m imagining it or not but it felt like you were giving us so much genuine love and care, only a billion times more; especially at the beginning with the &quot;hi, everyone&quot;. It made me feel so emotional on the inside. I did the poses/stretches ever so gently, moving slow &amp; protecting my body while taking deep, meaningful breaths. It changed my usual yoga practice in a much different way, somehow. I guess that&#39;s what it means not rushing anything, not wanting to be super active yet not focusing on your(self-) care. I used a pillow instead of a blanket which was a nice, comforting add. I loved discovering (experimenting!) new poses too",Sarah S.,2020-01-27T16:02:14Z,0

The stuff from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=20m23s"">20:23</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=23m07s"">23:07</a> has been a wonderful surprise for my body, I wasn&#39;t expecting to be so tense down there and the position gave me instant relief, I could stay there for hours probably.<br />I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m supposed to, but I wish I experienced the same relief though in other positions in which I feel nothing at all, such as the combination forward fall / flat back position / full standing, which is recurring is your sessions. Am I doing something wrong? Is there a video in your playlist in which you minutely explain how to do it in order to take the best from it?<br />Thank you for all your work and inspiration, Namaste &lt;3",breßaola,2019-12-15T08:49:58Z,0

"If you haven&#39;t found them yet, there are yoga basics videos. You&#39;re not going to feel  relief from everything. Sometimes because that part isn&#39;t tight, sometimes because it is not a stretch, but has another purpose like a plank pose or boat pose.",Lian Beijers,2020-10-26T17:35:50Z,0

Thank you so much for your videos and sharing all that beautiful knowledge with us. 4 months ago, I was using crutches and was facing a life of knee, shoulder hip and back pain due to various lifelong conditions.

Your teachings have changed my life Adriene and I cannot thank you enough. Gone are the crutches,  walking sticks and pills, they&#39;ve been replaced with a yoga mat and the gym. I begin every day with your lessons and I feel like a new man. I can even run and I was told that would never happen again.  I even needed help putting my shoes on, not anymore.

"I had been trying yoga classes at my gym, but they were too fast and too advanced for me as a beginner. They also didn’t fit with my schedule. A friend recommended your yoga videos and I have really been enjoying them, on my own schedule and at my own speed. The problem I have is that many poses really bother my knees - especially Warrior poses with my right knee bent. My knee seems to slip a bit in the joint because of worn cartilage. And poses with tightly bent knees are difficult. I would appreciate any suggestions you could provide.<br />Again, I am so happy to have found you!",suzyq525,2019-09-06T17:53:32Z,0

"Hi Adriene,<br /><br /><br />Thanks for this video. I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;d ever consider doing a video on yoga for SI pain. All the yoga vids I can find are geared toward lumbar pain which is not an issue for me, and a lot of the poses that are supposed to help release the lumbar muscles (e.g. supine goddess) are really compressive on the SI joints and don&#39;t feel good for me. I&#39;m sure there are a lot of women in particular out there, who think they have &quot;low back pain&quot; but actually have SI pain, who could really benefit from a video geared toward that!",Jennifer Pilon,2019-09-02T20:45:49Z,1
I find that a practice focusing on hip strength (rather than flexibility) goes a long way to SUPPORT the SI joints.  They move!  Don&#39;t let anyone tell you different:),Stephanie Carter Kelley,2019-09-12T13:54:13Z,0

I woke up this morning with lower back pain (fractured spine 27 years ago). After doing daily yoga for the last 20 months with YWA I didn’t reach for the pills but did this lovely session.

"Adriene, <br /><br />I have to truly thank you for changing my life. After struggling so long with depression, anxiety and losing 150lbs I felt like I needed something more for myself. After my workout yesterday with my trainer, I woke up with the WORST back pain I have ever experienced. Instead of freaking out and rushing to the pain killers a little tiny light went off inside my head and it said “Jazzmin look for a back yoga practice with Adriene!” <br /><br />After I was finished with this video I went right into finishing with your upper back yoga and I felt completely different! My mind was calmer and the pain was actually manageable. It’s crazy what yoga truly does for the body, mind and my spirit. I’m so obsessed with doing daily yoga with you that I just had to rant and share my experience. My little kitty Tiny and I always look forward to sitting down with you each morning and doing what makes us feel good:) <br /><br />Love you Adriene!!",Jazzmin J,2019-08-15T15:42:00Z,15

When you say breathe into your belly, but at the same time draw the navel in, I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do that.

"Dear Adriene I used to do yoga with your channel daily and was also subscribed to FWFG. This past year I&#39;ve suffered a herniated disk and two operations. I stopped my studies (I&#39;m an opera singer) stopped doing yoga and have been having trouble returning to basic things like meditation. I&#39;ve been too scared of more injury that the only sport i&#39;ve started doing is swimming.This past week my back was hurting terribly, giving me anxiety and stopping me from doing basically anything. Today, after months of not being on your channel, I did this video and am feeling so much better. I missed you, Adriene, I&#39;ve missed connecting movement with breath, mind and body. I will try to continue doing yoga again, and would appreciate your recommendations for videos that are suitable for someone healing from back surgery.

"First of all, Adriene, thanks for your videos.  They introduced me to yoga and I am much healthier now after doing it for about a year.  I do have a question for Adriene or anyone.  In that position where we put our heels together in front of each other, when the right heel is in first, I get a sharp pain in my right knee that gets worse when I try to fold forward.  Any thoughts on whether I am maybe doing something wrong?  Or maybe my knee just has something funky going on.  Today I moved my heels out a little so my right knee wasn&#39;t completely bent and that seemed to help.  I just wanted to get some wisdom on this because it happens every time I try to do that one.",David Roberts,2019-06-23T14:38:15Z,0

"I&#39;ve really been rocking out the Empower series on FWFG and feeling so great about how I&#39;ve been working my body and noticing changes in what I can do. Two days ago, though, I attended a little health expo at my work and part of it was a weightlifting demo. I ended up obviously doing something wrong with the deadlifts because I completely destroyed my lower back - like, the worst lower back pain I&#39;ve ever had (and I used to have back pain quite often back when I first started building my practice). I was so upset about the pain, of course, but mostly that I got thrown off of the Empower series and have to wait until my back is healed. I&#39;ve done this video yesterday and today and it has helped so much. My back is getting so much better and I am so grateful. I feel good taking care of my injury in this way and it helps me be patient about getting back to Empower when I really feel ready.",bluecenterlightpop91,2019-06-09T23:27:24Z,0

"So I couldn&#39;t finish 30 days &#39;cause I&#39;m that person who stops doing something healthy when pain goes away, but I&#39;m starting again and adding this as an extra practice between each day. Will try your other lower back practices as well. And I honestly can&#39;t praise this enough. I feel so much better when I do yoga, controlled exercise like this works really well for me. Obvious things, but really important to me: the fact that this content is available for free, I can do this in a comfort of my own home, can choose my own pace is amazing.

"Oh, this was so awesome! I feel like Ii did my lower back a world of good! It&#39;s so easy to stick to a daily yoga routine with you, &#39;cause even if I watch a video of yours for the first time - I know it will be mindful, gentle and (often) refreshingly funny! This is yoga for the mind and heart as well! In the middle I spilled my tea and made a real mess - but I was like &quot;okidoks, no probs. pause video. clean mess. move with a mindfulness and don&#39;t stress. Restart video. Breath.&quot; - Namasté!",lostjune,2019-05-22T11:19:51Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I absolutely love these videos and my girlfriend and I do them regularly. One thing I&#39;ve always wanted to ask - in some poses I find a certain muscle will start to spasm a little - more than just persistent tightness, there will be a point in the pose where it really seizes. An example might be getting into a forward fold. It seems the more I keep my back straight as I bend, the more my lower back muscles want to tense up. In the past I just ease off and try again another day, but it always makes me wonder what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m curious if the yoga perspective has anything say about experiencing sudden tensions like this? Thanks so much!",smwvogt,2019-05-22T01:57:06Z,0

I read your email yesterday and saw the focus was on lower back. I didn’t delete the email knowing that I might want to watch it since I’m having lower back pain. I’m not actively into yoga but from time to time I have taken a class. I did my first yoga class of 2019 last night, it was a stretchy beginner level class and it awakened my back. I woke up this morning with your email in my mind. I opened it and did the lower back class you taught in your video. Thank you. It is what I needed to begin my day.

"First off, I would like to thank you for making videos to help care for our bodies. I am a young adult whose neglected self-care for about 14+ years and overworked my body till its so stiff and tight. A good professor of mine gave me an idea to try yoga since I no longer play sports.<br />When I started with your beginner&#39;s playlist, I noticed how tight and painful each move was. Regardless, I took it slow and tried not to over due it. This is only day four and I&#39;ve begun to notice that I feel left tight after each session, especially my back. <br /><br />Secondly, I find that your guidance and explanation for each video easy, helpful, but most of all encouraging. I didn&#39;t think I could do many of these on my own or given up if it weren&#39;t for you.<br /><br />And lastly, I hope to continue getting better (since I decided to start caring for myself properly) with your help in each session. <br /><br />Thank you truly for these videos. 💜💙",Trickzter -Esther,2019-05-20T19:13:02Z,1

And of course, that is when I have more problems.  So I am going to try to incorporate your low back yoga once a week along with your stress less yogas, and try to stay with my stretching to see if I can keep my back healthy.

All these moves can be adapted for the chair.  Cat/Cow: slump and arch.  Boat pose: sit on the edge of the chair and lean back without resting on back. Seated forward bend:  spread knees and reach to the floor.  Can always stand and put a leg into the chair like for the stomach pose: Stand to side of the chair and put foot into the chair while holding the back of the chair.  Slowly turn foot on chair out and let the knee that is on the chair rotate in.,Stephanie Carter Kelley,2019-09-12T13:37:09Z,0

"Adriene, could you please post a routine for doing splits? I&#39;ve been doing yoga for a couple of months now and you&#39;re the only person that I feel extremely comfortable following. I&#39;ve looked for other instructors here, but I don&#39;t resonate with them. It would be amazing and extremely helpful. Thank you so much!",Nadia Sulaiman,2019-05-20T00:14:34Z,0

Since I started with my best friend we&#39;ve regularly watched your videos and often borrow routines or string several videos together to do them together.

One of the more difficult practices to understand how to do what is being described.  The rocking up and down the spine is something that is completely out of my reach.

"Hi Adriene! This one was great for me today. <br /><br /><b>**</b>  I have an idea I believe others might love. I know I would!  <b>**</b><br /><br />Briefly, I&#39;d like to begin with how this idea came to me (as I feel it helps support the idea itself!)<br /><br />I&#39;d aimed to do 30 days of yoga. I&#39;d tried this a few times before and kept failing and I was upset with myself for that, so this time I wanted to get it nailed down and I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. Challenges I could foresee that could lead to failure: I&#39;ve gotten a lot of migraines in life or sometimes am just super tired and wasn&#39;t sure how I&#39;d manage yoga on days like this but I sought for answers and then I got the idea to just do super gentle and short practices if those times happened, or even lie in Savasana if I had a super bad migraine. This plan helped me to finally succeed! I only had one headache day during the 30 days (today is day 32!) and it wasn&#39;t even very bad,  and I had a few times where I needed something short and gentle just due to my headspace or body needs at the time. For these, I sought out your bedtime yoga videos that were on the shorter side.<br /><br />A few show up when I do this search and so here is my idea that I believe others would love too: <br /><br />It would be amazing if there were simply more of these stretchy (even like this video here that was posted yesterday) on the ground, gentle practice videos in varying short lengths (7-8 minutes - 10-11-12 minutes - 14-15-16 minutes - 17-18-20 minutes - 22-24-26 minutes) so there could be a bigger selection of the varying length times for this type of yoga practice. These kinds of practices stand out easiest to me when they are labeled as bed-time yoga, as then I figure you really aren&#39;t going to have me doing planks or warrior poses, etc (which I do love as well for those times I love them, but def not for when I&#39;m just not feeling great for whatever reason that&#39;s the case). <br /><br />I then got this idea!!!!<br /><br />What if you did another 30 days of yoga series - but this could be 30 nights of yoga for bedtime! And everything in it could be of different lengths that aren&#39;t super long and they could be slow and gentle and stretchy - just for really calming down for bed for 30 nights straight! We could all practice a nightly routine for 30 days to calm us and center us and help us sleep better and then there&#39;d be all those night-time videos to add to the collection of clearly labeled super gentle yoga practices for times also when we don&#39;t feel our best but still wish to stay with our commitment to a daily practice. <br /><br />Anyway, it&#39;s just an idea and I don&#39;t know how challenging it is or isn&#39;t for you to plan and then execute a 30-day of yoga videoing spree. <br /><br />Thanks again for another lovely yoga practice in this video here!",Holly XO,2019-05-19T14:41:48Z,1

"This really hit the spot today. I do have a modification question. I have knee issues, and for the most part have learned to modify things pretty well, including sukhasana. But the sukhasana sequence here really does need your feet to come in that close and your knees to bend that tightly, which my bad knee just won&#39;t do. <br /><br /><br />I tried two variations: first with my legs in a very wide bound angle (knees at about 90 degrees, soles of the feet together) and second with legs straight(ish) in a seated forward fold. Both were more workable for the knees, but I&#39;m not sure either variation quite hit what you were aiming for with the back. Do you have any other recommendations for how to get the most out of this sequence when the knees just can&#39;t come in that tightly?",Diane Verrochi,2019-05-19T10:33:06Z,0
"Did you feel it stretch in the back in either of these positions?  If so, you are getting the intended stretch.  Both are good modifications (from a Yoga Physical Therapy perspective:).",Stephanie Carter Kelley,2019-09-12T13:29:10Z,0
"I always get excited when I see you&#39;ve uploaded and I&#39;m very thankful for your channel, at home yoga has helped me so much. x<br /><br /><br />P.s.

"Hi Adrienne, I really love your channel.  I have attempted yoga many times, but am learning more since joining your channel.  I have a question.  When in the seated position heels to groin I have a hard time bringing my right heel in that way.  It seems to be more heel to upper thigh.  I have osteoarthritis to my right knee, so it’s not as flexible.  Any ideas how to get the same feeling from the position??  Thanks so much for what you do on this channel.",Mika Fellows,2019-05-19T08:46:48Z,0
"no need to cross the legs or even bend at the knee for this pose.  The goal is to stretch the back, so keep the knees straight but separated into a wide leg forward bend.  Work on knee range of motion and flexibility in other positions.  You can probably get better at that too.",Stephanie Carter Kelley,2019-09-12T13:43:08Z,0

"This has to be the kindest gentlest yoga practice for the lower back ever. It leaves me feeling super comfy and relaxed. At the same time I think it reached parts not usually reached and that’s where the benefit lies. Since practicing with you Adriene I can honestly say I have had no back pain whatsoever, something I previously felt quite often. “ I’ve got your back “ is something you say regularly and you certainly have. You are super yummy, feeling the love 💞. See you tomorrow for Day 20 of OPEN 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💞",Gill Smith,2019-05-19T08:14:05Z,0

"Truly magical. I&#39;ve got some really spirit draining lower back pain from all the electrical muscle stimulations I had to undergo this week in a physiotherapy session. Thank you Adriene for coming to our aid once again, doing it as gently as ever, and for promoting positivity and love in the middle of all this external chaos that we have no control over. We do, however, have control over our thoughts and what we feed our subconscious mind. That is why I love my Sunday yoga mornings that act as a gate way to tend to my deeper self and rewire my brain for a better life. Loved the core action in this one Adriene. Have a magical day everyone. Keep thriving. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-05-19T05:13:32Z,0
