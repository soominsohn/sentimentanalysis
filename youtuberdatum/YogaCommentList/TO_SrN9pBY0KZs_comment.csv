"The &#39;core&#39; is the skeleton; hug all muscles to the bone 360 degrees around -- <br />the trick is, all bones are anchored to  (by some joint or another) the spine, which is highly held up/supported by the abs...<br />Having rock hard abs sucks if your limbs are soft, and having rock hard limbs sucks if your abs are soft. <br />Often, &#39;balance&#39; is viewed linearly on a right/left spectrum, but I&#39;ve found it much more helpful to view it holistically when it comes to &#39;core&#39; work. <br />This sequence is so powerful!

"Adriene you are so amazing and I want to thank you for your wonderful videos!  I am 62 and about the tightest person around and I was told by a friend Betsy Markle, my Dragon Boat team mate,  nutritionist, yoga instructor and owner of Sunshine Wellness in Indian Harbor Beach, Fl  to try your videos.  I started out strong with the yoga for beginners and I truly felt so much better!  I fell off my routine and just watched this core strength and can’t wait to be able to do it, but I know I have to do the basics first again. This week I am in Colorado Springs with my Dragon Boat team, Heart and Soul for the National Championships! My teammates are all above age 50 to 70’s and have all worked so hard to get us here and I am so proud and honored to be with them and I owe it to them to get my flexibility and core back to Strong Strong and am committing myself to following you at least 3 times a week!  My boat has already qualified for the World Championships in France 2020 and our breast cancer survivor boat needs to qualify this weekend at Nationals! So thank you again and I want to encourage any others who can’t even stand on one leg to give your videos a try!  Love to Benji too<br />nutritionist",Lisa Ellison,2019-08-22T13:23:34Z,0

My instructor says I am doing all my poses in the correct form, and I just bought a thicker mat (a manduka 5mm) to see if that will help. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could be doing wrong? Or is this common with new yogis and will pass?

I don’t know what I would do without you. These videos have been with me nearly every step of my healing journey the past 5 years. I’ve been doing them almost daily for 1.5 years and am in the best shape of my life (I’m 47). Every time I share my mat time with you I fall a little more in love with myself.

"Suggestion: I&#39;ve been through a couple of the 30 day journeys and a lot of other videos, and I have to say I love the more independent practices at the end. I find that doing one guided practice with Adriene and then choosing some flow-y music for more independent practice is so helpful because you learn, but then you also force yourself to listen to your own body and build up that trust in your intuition.",genericbotface,2019-08-11T16:07:56Z,1

Can you make a full calendar as part of your merch? Like a “yoga for 2020” calendar and then you can leave sundays blank for the new videos/rest day???

Also every month can be a quote or picture of you and benji 🤗 I feel like I have too many calendars to keep track of 😅,Michele Janelli,2019-08-11T15:42:16Z,0

Hey Adriene. I&#39;ve been following your channel for 5 years now and this comment can never thank you enough for all you&#39;ve given. I love you and just wanted to share this trick I found to get more out of your videos. I adjust the playback speed to .75 and I find it easier to keep up without having to pause. It gives me more a chance to find what feels good. Try watching this video at .75x speed and see what you think! Love from Montreal. Namaste:),Max Headroom,2019-08-11T12:45:17Z,0

"I&#39;ve already done a core workout today and felt like something a little extra before I head off to bed, and this was absolutely perfect! I feel like I&#39;ve been neglecting my core recently, despite doing a lot of work for it and the rest of my body, so more than anything this video proved to myself that I have been making progress!!

"This one was a bit of a challenge for me in knowing and respecting my own limits. I&#39;m in the middle of moving to a different country, and because of that (the stress but also just carrying a lot of boxes), my old shoulder issues are playing up, which I felt today especially in the second half of this practice. I tend to get really frustrated when I notice the pain and that I&#39;m limited in what my shoulder can do, so today I tried to just pay attention to how strong the rest of my body is and how I can modify my practice to support my shoulders.",Eline Castelijns,2019-08-11T08:40:38Z,38

"I was not doing yoga, for past few days, i was feeling exhausted, emotionally broken down, and heartbroken, i really tried to do yoga, because it really helped, but when i started your video, every time i started to cry and couldn&#39;t go on, i just stopped the video and did something else. But, today, i felt like today was the day i&#39;m going to control myself, and i did it! It felt, unbelievably amazing, i cried but still, continued to flow and it was magnificent. Thank you Adriene, really, i don&#39;t know what should i do without you. Namaste and շնորհակալություն as we say in armenian 🙏🏻❤❤❤❤❤",Liana,2019-08-11T08:24:04Z,1

I find it harder for my shoulders and upper arms (during the plank moves) than for my core. I guess I have weak upper body strength! Thank you for the video x x x,PsychoPrincess13,2019-08-11T08:04:05Z,3
"For Day 11 of REUNITE I loved this new practice. They are always an adventure and go so quick ! Core work is my favourite and there were some awesome new moves in there and a sharksfin child’s pose yummy 😊👍🏻 Now Adriene, when it comes to those side planks ..... this senior yogi with arthritis added my own version so I could enjoy the moment 😂 I just supported myself with my lower knee down. I breathed deep and stretched high, sooo good but I promise to persevere with this one and improve 😉 Awesome practice, thanks Adriene 🙏🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️💞",Gill Smith,2019-08-11T08:03:33Z,1

I love these core practices but I always need to make adjustments during boat variations because I get crazy pain from my tailbone since I lost padding there ☺️ I used to get really bummed I couldn’t joined in but then I remembered that we’re all different and mindful adjustments are just a great act of self care 😊 namaste Adriene and Benji I hope every yogi has a wonderful Sunday 💛💛💛💛🌸,Jess Nolan,2019-08-11T07:52:01Z,0

"Hey Adriene , Muskaan here . I am suffering from social anxiety and low self esteem (I’m excessively obese too) I’m super addicted to my phone, I want to realign my life and I’m new to yoga , earlier I used to do it with ease and now Phone is getting the better out of me . I want to start all over again . Please suggest me what I should Do ? I really love your videos as you encourage me to be positive :) <br />Love you &lt;3",Muskaan Jain,2019-08-11T07:35:05Z,0

Just had another go at this and it definitely went better and I&#39;m feeling more positive. Like Adrienne says - it&#39;s not just about the abs. Coming back to the mat to attempt this again means I&#39;m showing my precious body some much needed love. 💙,Vicky Kay,2019-08-16T08:31:18Z,0

"After coming back to yoga from illness, I felt a lot of discomfort in my wrists, especially at the end of this session. Could anyone recommend a solution to this problem? I remember a year ago general yoga practice alleviated this, but now I fear with me being weaker I could do some real damage with the best intentions. If it persists I&#39;ll consult my doctor, but for now I&#39;d be grateful for some advice.",Charlie Day,2019-08-11T06:08:54Z,0
