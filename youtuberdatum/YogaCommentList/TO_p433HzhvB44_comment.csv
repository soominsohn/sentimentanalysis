"I was told about Yoga with Adriene in January. And I did Breath and have continued the journey with the monthly calendar. I am noticing things especially between my head and body. Recently, yesterday included, have dealt with bowel obstructions or partial ones. The difference yesterday was I was noticing gut things before it got really obstructed. Perhaps next time I’ll do something about it when I first feel “off.” I tell all this to thank you! I did this class specifically to nurture the gut that had such pain yesterday.",Jill-Allyn McCluskey,2021-04-20T13:17:19Z,0

"I&#39;ve done this one every couple nights since I found it and I love it so much. It has made me realize how much I&#39;d been unconsciously clenching my stomach muscles and not giving my body the breath it deserves for years, which has probably contributed to the numerous and nightmarish GI problems I&#39;ve had for years.

"The elements of the body<br /><br />There are two main energies: spiritual energy and material energy. Spiritual energy is conscious and material energy is unconscious. The soul is conscious spiritual energy and the body is made up of unconscious material energy. Without food, there would only be the self, the soul aka (1) antimatter towards unconscious matter with a size of .1 nanometer with its shells.<br /><br />According to the Sankhya philosophy, a person&#39;s body is composed of the following 24 elements:<br /><br />(1-5) 5 mahābhūtas (&quot;great elements&quot; - earth, water, fire, air, ether / space),<br />(6) manas (mind, inclinations, spirit),<br />(7) buddhi (intelligence),<br />(8) ahaṅkāra (ego  as a result of identification with the body and what goes with it),<br />(9-13) 5 senses acquiring knowledge (indriya - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch),<br />(14-18) 5 working senses (karmendriya - legs, arms, anus, genital and speech organ),<br />(19-23) 5 sensory objects (indriyārtha - shape / color, sound, taste, smell and touch),<br />(24) avyakta (the unmanifest)<br /><br />The five great elements, the ten senses and the five sense objects make up the gross body and manas, buddhi, and ahaṅkāra make up the subtle body. Avyakta is the basis of both. In this connection of 24 elements sits the individual soul (jivātma) as an inhabitant of the body, accompanied by the paramātma, the oversoul.<br /><br />.With soul and oversoul, the human being consists of 26 elements. Jivātma and paramātma are both referred to as kṣetra-jña (&quot;knower of the field&quot;). The body is kṣetra, the field of activity, and the soul is the knower of the field. But while the Oversoul knows all fields of all living beings, the individual soul does not even properly know its respective body. Through unthinkable long contact with the material energy, the spiritual souls have forgotten their original knowledge and identify with the body in which they are currently living. With the body they try to enjoy by manipulating material nature and exploiting the riches of material nature.<br /><br />These 24 elements are manifestations, transformations of the material energy and exist in and outside the body as constituents of the universe. Their development, properties and interactions are described in various Vedic scriptures and also in the Ayurveda classic Caraka-Samhita. Just as a potter makes a jug out of clay and water, the spiritual soul, under the influence of the three modes of appearance, sattva (goodness) , rajas (passion), tamas (ignorance), unconsciously creates its respective body from the 24 material elements through its inclinations. In contrast to the potter, who knows how to make a certain object, most souls do not know how they made their bodies. They carry out certain actions with one body, cherish certain likes and dislikes, etc. and receive their next body from the Oversoul according to their karma<br /><br />The three doṣas (bioenergies and bioelements), the seven dhātus (types of body tissue), the upadhātus (subsidiary body tissue) and the malas (waste products) contain the mahābhūtas in different proportions. The seven dhātus are:<br /><br />rasa (lymph; plasma)<br />rakta (blood)<br />maṃsa (muscle tissue)<br />medas (fat tissue)<br />asthi (bone tissue)<br />majja (bone marrow and nerve tissue)<br />śukra (sperm and egg cells)<br /><br />The upadhātus are tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, muscle fat, breast milk, menstrual blood and the six layers of skin.<br /><br />The body&#39;s breakdown products are feces, urine and sweat. Hair, fingernails and toenails, ear wax, and other secretions are also considered malas. The malas feces, urine and sweat, ear wax and other secretions need to be eliminated regularly. If they are not properly eliminated, disease will arise.<br /><br />( From the signs and symptoms caused by the increase or decrease in doṣas, dhātus and malas, the doctor can determine which mahābhūtas are required to restore their equilibrium. Then he can prescribe certain foods and drugs (with corresponding mahābhūtas) to compensate for the deficits or excess of mahābhūtas in doṣas etc.)<br /><br />Whether there are other energies and what these are all about can be found in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures.<br /><br />(1) Whatever we see within this universe, within material world and spiritual world, the spiritual world is expansion of internal energy, and this material world is expansion of external energy, and we living entities, we are expansion of marginal energy. So three energies.  Multi-energies. All the multi-energies grouped in three headings: antaraṅga-śakti, bahiraṅga-śakti, taṭastha-śakti. Antaraṅga-śakti means internal energy, bahiraṅga śakti means external energy, and taṭastha-śakti means these living entities (cit kana part and parcel). We are śakti; we are energy. We are not the energetic.",matthias elsner,2020-09-29T10:36:45Z,0

"Yoga with Adriene is literally a life line for me.  3 months ago I had a kidney transplant.  My recovery has been very difficult from the intensity of the immune suppressing medication causing multiple side effects,  infection and very low cell counts from lowered immunity and deep struggles emotionally from the trauma of organ transplantation. Finding balance in recognizing the elements that encompass what total healing is, for me begins in learning how to adequately care for myself to nourish physically,  emotionally and spiritually in this &quot;new body with very changed needs&quot;.  Right now, there is no other way for me to begin overcoming the enormity of the obstacles I&#39;m facing but to put the work in myself.  I&#39;m finding these moments on my mat connecting to specific sessions on Yoga with Adriene have given me the ability to better listen to my body, what its saying, asking for, observing my deep breathing (or lack thereof alot) and recognizing where I&#39;m holding my stress and trauma.  It&#39;s a day to day practice and one I&#39;m just really starting on navigating my way through without preconceived thoughts about where I need to or will end up.  It&#39;s not about getting to the end point its about being willing to consider possibilities about the importance of giving myself the best care I can in however I hear and feel my body talking to me.  I&#39;ve already created a playlist of sessions that speak most to me and already feel the benefits of that practice in myself as a whole ♡",jenn,2020-07-20T00:16:39Z,0

Also just want to take a minute to say THANK YOU. I have to tell you, your philosophy on whole body and mind wellness over weight loss or body type is so refreshing. I looked the other day just for something a little more sweat inducing (Pilates or dance type workouts) but I have not been able to find a single YouTubed who I feel is truly body positive, about strength and feeling good, not just about looking a certain way. I think as women we get enough of that pressure daily out in the real world.

Just found a new favourite! This is why I love Adriene&#39;s calendars - I discover practices I wouldn&#39;t have chosen otherwise. Namaste!,Daisy,2020-06-11T08:15:11Z,19
"Hi Adriene and (subscribers)! I&#39;ve been active all my life and involved in competitive team sports (beach volleyball, swim team, baseball, softball) and have been dedicated to circuit training (hiit) for 20+ years...and over the past couple of years, I have felt my lower back and right sciatica starting to give me more and more problems-<del>to the point that I was having a hard time sleeping--and then walking. I started having to back off working out and was even struggling with bending over. My lower back pain increased to the point that it would take my breath away and I would just stop moving and stand still until the pain subsided. I have always heard from my friends how valuable yoga is, but I just resisted trying it...not sure why...maybe just not an &quot;active&quot; way to work out like I was used to.  Three days ago, I was frustrated and nearly in tears because I couldn&#39;t believe how badly my lower back hurt, and how my quality of life was starting to deteriorate so quickly. It was on my heart to search on YouTube for a yoga program for my lower back, and &quot;Yoga with Adriene&quot; was one of the first sites to appear. I have an Australian Cattledog named &quot;Prairie&quot; and when I saw &quot;Benji&quot; ---I knew I was in the right place! I dedicated myself to giving your class a try, and I am stunned at the positive results! In just 3 days, I am walking with less and less pain...and I am back to circuit training again! And just like you say on your video&#39;s, I have become more and more mindful of how my body is moving and feeling in the walk of life--and now that I am back in the gym, this mindfulness just seems to leap out at me as I move from workout equipment to workout equipment. &quot;Yoga with Adriene&quot; is how I start my day--I then move into the circuit training--and then back to my Yoga mat to cool down and stretch to another&quot; Yoga with Adriene&quot; course. I am feeling better and better with each passing day and am now totally committed to adding Yoga to my day--every day! I wish I would have started Yoga many, many years ago and added it to my workouts. As flexible as I am, there are some positions and movements that I cannot do---yet--or maybe ever. I love how Adriene reminds us to not get lost in being perfect! Lastly, my careers have gone from Beach Lifeguard to EMT to Police Officer---and now I am in the clinical psychology profession where I work with military, law enforcement and paramedic/firefighters. Many of my clients struggle with PTSD, anxiety and panic disorders. I forward &quot;Yoga with Adriene&quot; to these clients who are having panic attacks and the positive results have been wonderful! &quot;Yoga with Adriene&quot; is an amazing mindfulness and grounding journey. I encourage the readers: give yoga a try! Don&#39;t wait as long as I did!  Thank you, Adriene for your dedication and heart! Here&#39;s a hug from Prairie to Benji!  --</del> Jim McLintock, Southern California   <a href=""http://www.mclintockcounseling.com/"">www.McLintockCounseling.com</a>",James McLintock,2020-06-09T16:58:16Z,0

"Wow, just wow.<br />Let me share something with you. <br />I haven’t done much yoga for quite a time now and I don’t even know why. <br />Yes, I go to yoga class every Tuesday but that’s nothing compared to doing a little every day. And I do feel it. Something&#39;s missing and there’s tension instead. A lot of tension.<br />Now, after doing only one of your videos I feel so much better because I found what’s been missing. Finally, I feel the peace within myself again. It’s always been there but I’ve got to wake it up every now and then because it falls asleep if I don’t pay attention.<br /><br />My goals are now to become fitter and more flexible but also calm and relaxed. <br /><br />However, I won’t forget that a little goes a long way so I’ll try to be patient.<br /><br />Thanks a lot 🙏🏼",BeyondTheBop,2019-12-05T17:50:11Z,0

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for nearly 5 years and people always ask me why I follow these videos instead of doing my own practice, which I would have enough skill for. But if I&#39;m being honest, I don&#39;t watch Adriene because I feel like I need her to guide me through the practice but because she is so calming and therapeutic to listen to. Adriene you say the right things at the right time and I feel like I&#39;ve found a friend in you. You&#39;re a bit like my daily therapist appointment. I can think my anxious thoughts but also silence them if I need to. You hold up a mirror to my face and it helps me see things clearer.

Thank you sooo much for all these great videos! For a long time I said I wanted to practice yoga and it wasn&#39;t until I found your videos that I actually started. You and your team really gave me the boost I needed. The results have been amazing as well. I wish everyone who isn&#39;t practicing could know how good it makes you feel. I used to have a lot of stress and anxiety because of work and well life. But coming to the mat on a daily basis has helped me to feel grounded and here. I finally understand what being here now means. You have also inspired me to go deeper beyond just the physical aspect of what yoga is. Again thank you so much for helping me start this exciting chapter of my life. Namaste!,Nurha Leite,2019-12-02T10:37:31Z,0

"This practice brought me joy, I can&#39;t really explain it, but it did.<br /><br />I really love shorter practices like this one, 13-20 minutes of practice feel doable to me, not very intimidating  and when I&#39;m done and need more, I could just add a few more poses, repeat parts of it, or, heck, even start another short practice. Longer practices intimidate me because I feel like I won&#39;t be able to finish or that I would be late for bed (I do yoga before sleep) so I end up always doing a short one and skipping the long ones.",Nahla Aly,2019-12-02T05:01:52Z,1

"Once again, your timing is beautiful Adriene. I was just recently diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, which is just about as fun as it sounds lol. I still haven’t found the right medication for me, so I deal with frequent cramping from colon spasms and general digestive pain, and I spend a lot if my time curled up in a ball clutching my tummy. This is such a sweet little practice that feels like I’m genuinely doing something good for my body in its current time of need. I didn’t realize how long it had been since I just took a ~deep breath~ until I filled my whole stomach with air at the beginning of this practice and immediately felt 100x better. Might be making this video part of my evening ritual for the time being. Big feelings of healing vibing off of this ❤️❤️ thank you friend",Claire Feather,2019-12-01T23:57:57Z,1

Drank some sorrel...chilled out with my &quot;pilla&quot;. &lt;3 Good to be here wth Adriene and the kula, again. Don&#39;t have any reason I&#39;ve been away, necessarily. It was around that time 6 months ago that I started volunteering more of my time. Not sure if this is my first day of going back to daily. Let&#39;s wait and see.

You give us lots to think about with each practice...challenging us to find what feels good...read a few days ago on a different thread related to an almost hour long session that some think they need longer because they have been doing that one too many times and are maxed out ... an idea: look inside to hear the Nameste ...

"@Jess Nolan I wish the same , thank you :))",Khushi Maheshwari,2020-05-31T17:44:26Z,1
Khushi maheshwari hey! So sorry to hear you’re having the same experiences :( I tracked what I ate and figured that dairy was a consistent culprit for me so I tried eliminating it for two weeks and reintroducing it to see how my body reacted. It didn’t react well! So I cut it out. I also experience discomfort with shellfish and anything high in sugar. Anything sugary and I get quite a lot of discomfort! I was diagnosed with IBS by a doctor about 7 years ago and was advised to make changes to my diet that benefited my gut health :) it’s a difficult thing to work out but all of our guts are so different one thing that is good for one may be bad for another. I hope you find a way to find comfort though! 🖤🖤 xx,Jess Nolan,2020-05-31T17:07:02Z,1

"Letter of appreciation to Adriene. <br />Dear Adriene, before your letter arrived today, I had decided to write to you, for once. <br />I am by many years your senior. I was on the road of finding what feels good long before I met you, and I have come a long way. For four years now, you have been my young guide and companion, and I try to practice with you every day. <br />There are many things in our relationship I am grateful for. I will just share what particularly sparked my gratitude recently:  On your Yoga for tension relief you say at one point (6.37 minutes): „Tension … is a many splendored thing“, and then you laugh and get back to teaching. <br />It instantly sparked my joy, because I love that song, and many times a song’s words float to my mind like they do to yours. <br />But it also made me realize how much care is in your language. It is clear in every video that every word you use is the result of a loving, thoughtful process. And yet you still let yourself be spontaneous and make room for your whims and ideas! It is so beautiful to witness when you let your inner child out! <br />I can’t tell you how grateful I am for all the gifts I get from you every day. <br />Thank you.
