"It was nice to hear someone say “I got your back” this evening especially when I didn’t feel that from others, I was starting to feel alone and not supported with where I’m currently at in my life so I decided to get on my mat. Yoga has always been there for me. I just need to be willing to pull my mat out and sit. Thank you for reminding me of this Adriene. I appreciate your videos very much. I have a daily practice with you and the days I don’t pull out my mat I notice a difference. Thank you again for all that you do. ❤️",Valerie H,2019-10-13T04:05:39Z,2

"Adriene&#39;s inspiring videos have been my daily yoga practice for quite a while now. So when I got home from an upsetting encounter with my estranged brother yesterday, I knew where to turn to help me regain my sense of stability and strength: breathing, meditation and, of course, one of Adriene&#39;s compassionate videos. I typed &quot;pain&quot; in the search box and found this wonderful lesson. Thanks so much darling Adriene for your endless generosity. Namaste from Tel Aviv",dudidas4,2021-05-09T06:05:30Z,0

"we had to put my family dog down a few days ago, and overwhelmed by grief and emotion i haven&#39;t been able to move much or really do anything. this yoga practice was so relieving i felt sad when it ended. tears fell during the practice but i now realize that it&#39;s okay to cry and to let go and to suffer. thank you for making me feel whole in this awful time, sending much love your way and to everyone who may read this &lt;3",Maud Brummans,2021-05-06T14:37:43Z,0
"I&#39;ve been struggling with how I see myself lately. People saying that my suffering is an identity I&#39;m holding on to - and that has made me angry and insecure to my core.<br /><br />We suffer every day but try our best to care for ourselves, only to be told that we love our own suffering. <br /><br />No one has the right to trample over the ground of your life, tearing out the grass with their rude shoes and planting their flag in your soil. They don&#39;t know what you go through every day. You can listen to your pain. It is yours. We have turned away from it too long. It&#39;s time we heard it.",Kirstin C,2021-05-01T05:30:08Z,1

"I was surprised that a year later from doing this practice, I feel the same ! It is a kind, gentle sequence and it must be the slowest cat cow, downward dog workout ever, super stretchy and quite challenging for this suffering senior yogi, just coming out of a long lockdown here in England. But I just made it through ! Tomorrow’s our last day of Renew, is that the one on the balcony I wonder ? 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2021-04-29T07:00:12Z,6
"Thank you Laura, I am lucky not to suffer bad side effects from the vaccination, just a little tired for a day or two. I’m enjoying following the calendars and decided I would do, but to always be mindful and never push past my edge, keep safe and enjoy myself. Please take care and only go as far as you are comfortable. Being on the mat with Adriene every day is the best tonic 😊💕💕",Gill Smith,2021-05-01T20:04:56Z,1
@Gill Smith I hope you are not suffering today 🌷 Yesterday I couldn’t do it either. Thank you for reminding me it is respecting my body not being “lazy.” I’m really tried today and am nervous about anchor in hope but I guess it just matters I go on the mat. I want to get that habit in me like you have.,Laura Reed,2021-05-01T13:35:08Z,1

"@Gill Smith yeah this one was not a good one for me and I think it caused more suffering lol. I gave up when I started feeling pain which was a few minutes into it. All the blood flow and tension in the shoulders triggered a migraine. But no demons so I am sooooo relieved and I’ll take it. I don’t know if you feel the same way, but I’d much prefer physical pain to emotional. <br /><br />I hope you aren’t feeling sore in the arms and shoulders tomorrow. See you on the balcony!",Laura Reed,2021-04-29T21:55:53Z,1
"Laura, I wouldn’t have recommended this for you! I was surprised how challenging it was and I should have stopped before the last downward dog pose. I hope you were very mindful if you did it 😯 Tomorrow  IS the one on the balcony and rather flowing if I remember, do take care 🤞🧘🏼‍♀️💕",Gill Smith,2021-04-29T17:33:45Z,1

"Adriene, thank you for this. At the beginning of the year I did your videos for three months religiously. Then I moved into a new apartment, living on my own for the first time, and all of the little ways I would normally take care of myself fell by the wayside. Since then, I have been struggling. Last week I had a good talk with a mentor who encouraged me to bring those back, so this was the first video I chose to ease back into it. Such a beautiful practice, I definitely cried in moments.

"I normally adore the mental healing practices Adriene puts out, but the first half of this one left me irritated because my shoulders and wrists were aching, which was not what I wanted when I&#39;m already suffering. I ended up crying from frustration and am going to go do the yoga for depression or grief one, but I wanted to love this one. On a day when I&#39;m not suffering, this probably would have been great! Maybe it speaks more to what&#39;s going on beneath my suffering, but this wasn&#39;t it for me today.",Jae Henricksen,2021-02-04T19:04:29Z,0
I had to let someone go today. We haven&#39;t known eachother for long. But shared a deep intimacy. One of protection and nurturing. She was outside without boots in the middle of winter. I took her to a hotel to warm up. I held her in my arms. She was shivering for hours. I did not sleep. But I stayed with her. My heart energy warming her. The next morning I arranged for her to get proper warm clothes. She carried on as if nothing happened. I blocked her messages because seeing her destroy herself was hurting me. I let her go... now I am saddened. But this yoga practice helped immensely. Namaste 👐,Kinetic MC,2021-01-29T00:16:23Z,0

"I am going through a hard time,  not only because of Covid.  I have problems with anxiety, depression and past trauma and it&#39;s all coming up once again,  but Yoga truly helps.  Whenever I feel the pain coming up I force myself on the mat,  against my head telling me to just give in,  and it makes my mind so quiet and calm.  Doing several practices a day sometimes just to feel okay,  but it&#39;s working.  I know it&#39;s been a year since this was uploaded,  but I am so grateful to her kind words and to have such a good practice.

I made it not even half way through and honestly I only did child&#39;s pose and puppy posture. but I was so happy to have a moment to think about why I was so hurt. it&#39;s hard to acknowledge pain but if I don&#39;t do it now it will only continue to effect me as it already has.

"Today was the first day since my ED treatment I did yoga without getting mad and frustrated at my body for not doing it &quot;right&quot; I know there is no right way to do yoga, but it used to feel so much easier. Yesterday I decided I needed to stick with it. I want to heal my body and mind and I know yoga is the way. I realized a lot of my excused to avoid yoga, when I used to call myself a full yogi, were ED talking and wasn&#39;t the truth.

Today during this practice I fell apart.  I wasn&#39;t expecting it.  The tears caught me by surprise.  I have been doing so much to support others and offer that space to be vulnerable, that I have not given that same attention to myself.  I haven&#39;t been on my mat in days and as soon as I returned it was there to catch me.  I am now letting the tears fall as they wish and taking this time to cleanse and heal.

"I just love how well you explain the purpose of a pose and what we should be doing.<br />I had a very good teacher who was very keen on telling us those details and it&#39;s helped for my solo journey, but I&#39;d rather follow along than do yoga solo. But, I found it hard to find an instructor online I could really trust while doing yoga.  Some instructors brute through the poses, or maybe assume their audience already know&#39;s whats expected.  Anyway.  <br />Even if a student knows what to do in a pose, during the session when it&#39;s hard, or when they get focused on their breath, it&#39;s always great to have a guiding voice to remind them what the purpose is and aim towards that even more.<br />You&#39;re a teacher with exactly what I need, so I thank you so much.<br />And I really really love this gentle vibes practice that is a little more active than most calming sessions.<br />If any of that made sense hahahah",Candace Farrell,2020-04-15T15:57:48Z,2

"Thank you, Adriene. I found this gentle and healing experiencing lots of feelings. What you said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reASzZP63HQ&amp;t=5m44s"">5:44</a> and ending with &quot;I got your back (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reASzZP63HQ&amp;t=6m03s"">6:03</a>) helped me release some tears and emotions. Being brought up as a male in US culture was not a kind mindset for encouraging self-care or gentleness in my experience. This is a big way to help guide me in that direction and let go. Namaste :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: I also want to be honest that I’m in pain daily with my lower back to my foot on my left side. I’m not sure if it’s sciatica, a hip imbalance, or something else. Yoga seems to provide temporary relief. Maybe with consistency, PT, acupuncture, chiropractor, and more I can have physically pain free days again. It’d be a gift. <br /><br /><br />I just found out you were in the movie Joe, which I thoroughly enjoyed. If anyone hasn’t seen it it’s with Nicholas Cage from 2013 (I’ll link it below).<br /><br /><br />I hope you’re able to fulfill many of your life passions and talents. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382396/"">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382396/</a>",Deer in Headlights,2019-09-09T03:05:44Z,1

"Last week I was on vacation and didn&#39;t get a chance to do this video. I am thirteen years old and I have been doing yoga with adriene everyday for a year now to help ease my anxiety and I love it. But last night, I was on a vacation somewhere else and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep and this may sound a bit silly, but I was having a panic attack and crying and I couldn&#39;t stop. I decided to turn on this video, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reASzZP63HQ&amp;t=12m00s"">12:00</a> at night, and I laid in bed watching it and it calmed me down completely.

"-Hello Adriene! I hope you get the opportunity to see this comment, as I know it will be difficult for you to read them all. You have been my teacher now for more than two years! Through this whole journey you&#39;ve seen me go through some of my lowest points and helped me through them. I owe so much of my health and happiness to you and your channel. I wanted to reach out to you to thank you for all that you do for people. To provide us this channel for free and use all that you make to continue to give is just remarkable.<br />-However, through this entire time there has been one thing I wish I could tell you. I am &quot;double jointed&quot; meaning my joints are so flexible they can come somewhat out of socket in my normal range of motion. I experience this throughout my entire body. Sometimes it is a huge advantage for yoga and other exercise, but most of the time it is quite painful and is a hinderance. I just paused your video now as my shoulders and elbows began to come out and pinch my nerves. I modify your moves for myself but I&#39;m not the greatest at it as I do not know anatomy as well as a yoga teacher does. I would so greatly appreciate if you could take the time to learn more about what it&#39;s like for people like me and work on modifications to common poses so we can get the most out of these moves. I just know I&#39;m missing out on all the benefits your videos have to offer. <br />-To anyone else reading this would you be so kind as to like this comment so there is a greater chance of Adriene seeing it? This means a great deal to me and has for a long time, and there may be others watching this that feel the same.",Gaje Dayringer,2019-07-17T18:44:00Z,0

"I didn&#39;t know I needed this so much but I thought, &quot;On paper, I am suffering... maybe this will help me in some way,&quot; although I could not imagine how. Somewhere halfway through, the &#39;magic of yoga&#39; had me in the throes of release, tears coming down, breathing deeply to meet them. What a profound magic. I have always known yoga to be this magical unfolding, but it is tricky for me to find teachers I trust to go there with. This teacher is kind and loving, and home is (finally) the safest zone. I am getting a lot out of this at-home practice as I journey through a major life transition.

I allowed the disease to consume me since I couldn’t control what is going on with my grandpa.<br /><br />This practice reminded me that everyone is suffering with something.

"This month marks the third year I have been doing yoga – almost every day I have been greeted by Adriene&#39;s welcoming smile as I stepped on my yoga mat.<br /><br />I am now in my mid-twenties. For me, yoga started as a simple workout practice of shaking during downward dogs and falling out of tree poses, then eventually turned into a habit, and finally evolved into a ritual of self-care and checking in. <br /><br /><br />I never expected a yoga practice through youtube to be so involving and inviting. Looking back on these three years, I realize that Adriene played a significant role in some of the biggest events in my life so far. Through these videos, Adriene motivated me 2 hours before I nervously defended my thesis. She reminded me to have my own back when I suffered from my first heartbreak. She was also there when I met and embraced my first true love – my loving boyfriend who has become one of the most beautiful parts of my life right now. Since last year, Adriene is also there while I grief the unexpected passing of my father. As tension frequently builds in my hips, my shoulders, my neck, I still make sure to show up on my mat. <br /><br />And thanks to you, Adriene, I no longer see grief and suffering as emotions that must be fought or hidden. Rather, you have given me the tools to approach these emotions without judgement. After all, how could I ever find peace in these dark places if I am not willing to shed a light onto them? Though I love how yoga has brought me physical flexibility and release, I cannot thank you enough for helping me to allow grief, however difficult it still is, to become a part of my emotional reality. <br /><br />Throughout these years, your presence has brought me so much physically, mentally, emotionally and maybe even spiritually – though that is a journey I have not quite yet embarked on. After all this time, I want you to know just how much joy and freedom you have brought me in these years, and how much I look forward to stepping on my mat for years to come. Thank you. Namasté.",Jesper Veltried,2019-07-14T21:08:01Z,386

"This is the best practice yet! Perhaps I am uniquely sensitive as I have been bouncing around your timeline, Adriene—yesterday I used a video that was more than a few years old and today get treated to something recorded within the last few days. Your growth and development as a teacher shines brightly. I kept pace with you, you stayed focused, I was present for your words, your teachings, and got so much from today. We all suffer from something, a part of the human experience. But this practice helps to redefine how we respond to that injustice of suffering and in doing so, moves us one little step closer to enlightenment, or at least freedom from suffering.

I think a kink in the armor that is mindfulness and its current wave is that to wears off quicker than the inward focus. Like our society is to quick to return to an outwear view as a source of suffering and look at others to be mindful of them instead. It&#39;s a practice not really a cure.,eric wade,2019-07-14T17:38:30Z,0
"A part of knowing mindfulness is understanding that others don&#39;t have the same linking knowledge. It would be presumptuous to expect mindfulness of others, for they don&#39;t share a common timeline or inner wisdom.",eric wade,2019-07-14T18:16:48Z,0

"This morning when I saw the title of the video I thought “good, I’ll do it one day probably but thankfully, I don’t need it at the moment” and I did one of the empowerment monthly videos (the 1 hour long one). (Which was sweaty but great. )<br />By the end of the day though, I needed it badly. It was one of these days when things didn’t go too well, and I ended up rolling my mat again tonight while tears were swelling up. By the end of the extended child pose series of breaths at the very beginning of the video, I didn’t feel like crying anymore, and felt already much better. The magic of yoga (and your voice dear Adriene!). <br /><br />I’m the only one in control of my own happiness. And I took a step in the right direction tonight doing this video instead of crying myself to sleep and feeling sorry for myself. I trust. I love. Thank you so much Adriene. <br />Namaste. 🙏🏻",isabelleyab,2019-07-14T15:09:07Z,1

That&#39;s a little bit scary... How did you know that I am currently suffering but so far couldn&#39;t bring myself to do your yoga for a broken heart video? It&#39;s as if you looked into my search history 🙈 but I&#39;ll try this workout later for sure,Look At My Books,2019-07-14T05:45:26Z,0

"Thank you to everyone for being so kind and empathetic. I finally did it and I felt a release I’ve been trying to keep in right at the end where our hands went to our belly and heart. It all happened so suddenly and I expect for this to happen again, as it is not a momentary suffering. Thank you, all, for your love and I hope those that are suffering too can start healing. ♥️",Adilene Landa-Gaulrapp,2019-07-17T14:54:43Z,18
"@Yoga With Adriene this is the nicest response I&#39;ve ever seen, thank you",myheartisfaraway,2019-07-16T00:57:29Z,7
"Been there, it so tough and that’s why it’s worth it!!! For me, I just started on autopilot.... going through the motions even through my brain and every part of my body said nah. Then one day i felt it, the healing kicked in and it was so sweet.... you will cry and laugh and feel scared and excited all at once!! It will feel so different from the numb darkness you are leaving behind! Day 1 of new beginnings! Good luck, you are loved and supported ❤️",Sunny Stephanie,2019-07-14T14:03:32Z,25

"Hey Adriene..Love your videos. Your yoga exercises really work for me. The video,  yoga for stress and anxiety, that you uploaded, really helped me feel calm and relaxed.",Pratichee Bhuyan,2019-07-14T05:11:29Z,14
"I don&#39;t know what it is but everytime I get the notification for a new practice from Adriene, a big, bright, ear to ear smile sits on my face, automatically eliminating any negativity in a matter of an instant. I guess such spells of wonder do exist outside of the Harry Potter wizardry world. They feel so much better in the real world in my opinion. I&#39;ve started a challenge to tend to myself and go deep inside more often, of course, disconnecting from the professional world as a part of my night routine. And obviously, Adriene&#39;s yoga videos are a pivotal component of that night routine. Thank you Adriene for inviting us to the world of self love and  transforming our lives for the better through the work you do. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-07-14T05:10:25Z,17
