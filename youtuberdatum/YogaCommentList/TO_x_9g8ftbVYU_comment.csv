"What kind of risk taker will you be today?<br />A playful one? A curious one?<br /><br />Be kind, stay safe. <br /><br />But darling, <br /><br />Go for it.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-06-09T14:16:06Z,473
Thank you adriene  the risk takers and anyone else who is taking part in the march move calender.<br />Im a few days late but its all fun hopping around our yoga mats with a 8 month puppy near the yoga mat.<br />Namaste and thanks to the community during lockdown.<br />We can all lean on each other.(bill withers song),Louise Edgington,2021-03-18T11:04:39Z,0
"Dear Adriene, thank you so much for all your time and energy. I enjoy your video&#39;s a lot and although my chaotic personality makes it impossible for me to do any same thing every day I find myself on the yoga mat with you at least 4 times a week. I&#39;ve been doing this for 4 years and it&#39;s really made my life better.<br />Although I really love your videos and I usually enjoy every minute of them, the last few weeks I&#39;ve felt a lot of resistance. Maybe this sounds really stupid but I find that when I&#39;m in a certain state of mind (read:irritated) I prefer video&#39;s where there&#39;s only directions and no other information or conversation.<br />Maybe this is a stupid question but would it maybe be possible to make a playlist with video&#39;s that are not as talkative (is that the right word? Sorry not a native English speaker)<br /><br />I hope you understand and please know that 95% of the time I love, love, love your quirkiness and jokes. It&#39;s just that in the pandemic days I sometimes really can&#39;t handle people speaking to me in the morning 😅<br /><br />Thank you again for you wonderful work!",Zarah Gwenan,2021-03-17T09:12:58Z,0

I&#39;ve been practicing yoga most days for three months and I finally managed to hold the crow pose with both feet of the ground for two whole breaths! Never thought I&#39;d get the other foot off the ground! Great way to start my day realising that I&#39;m making some really good progress! :) Feeling good!,Sophia in the City,2021-03-20T10:01:02Z,1

I absolutely loved this video!  Adriene gives the clearest instructions on how to do crow pose.  I was able to balance for a split second with her help and guidance.  And the best part now is that I’m no longer afraid to try it!  Loved all of her metaphors!  Thank you so much Adriene!,"Beth Larsen, Flute",2021-03-17T18:48:18Z,0
"After 8 months of practicing with you, I’m finally able to put my heels down for downward dog (which I had to add a vinyasa sequence bc my lower back did not feel too nice on forward fold.) Nevertheless, I’m finally feeling so good in my body, and the days that I’m not, I’m so grateful I can see your videos daily and practice, knowing it heals me, whether it’s physically, or emotionally/mentally.

I got closer to crow than I have gotten before. I think it was important to get the outward rotation of the arms goin&#39; on for me. I really agree with what you said at the end about the courage to show up and be ourselves. It feels especially risky these days with cancel culture being such a &quot;thing&quot;.

"I´m a daily risk taker as I´m a Forex trader, and what I´ve learned is that the is no gain if one does not take risks. But one must always limit one´s risk or else things can turn-out ugly...

"Hello everyone!<br /><br />A nice practice today. A bit emotional, a bit funny. I found tree pose easy although I had to back off the standing right leg briefly because of some sharp discomfort in the bone just below the knee to the left of the shin. Went back in, and it was fine the last time. No crow for me though today. Just was not happening. 🤪<br /><br />Move day 11. Day 158 in a row.",William B,2021-03-11T03:54:15Z,22

"I wasn&#39;t in the mood for yoga but managed to get myself on my mat today. Then Adriene said, &quot;You can lean on the wall for support.&quot; Me singing, &quot;Lean on me!&quot;  and shocked when Adriene sings it back to me a second later. :) From then on my mind went to a place where the rest of the flow was all musical references that I laughed and continued, including &quot;Listen to your heart... when it&#39;s calling for you,&quot;   &quot;hips don&#39;t lie,&quot;  &quot;heel toe dosey doe...&quot;, &quot;imagine all the people&quot;J, and &quot;You are not alone, I am here with you&quot;.  Even when she said &quot;are you there?&quot; and (it didn&#39;t quite match), I thought &quot;Is it me you&#39;re looking for?&quot; and (I know this is not a song) Woody from Toy Story saying, &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; and Fonzie&#39;s &quot;ehh&quot;.  Mood definitely uplifted lol!   anyone else?",carushka,2021-02-13T11:30:09Z,3

Sometimes there is a lot of excess talking.. about really great stuff, but there is a lot and I find that distracting and not as pleasant if I could just rely on more of my own inner info that i get from my body while i do the practice (regarding philosophy and consciousness). I really love the hilarious unexpected things you say sometimes fyi... that def brings me in the moment and makes me smile :) Please don&#39;t let this be discouraging, ur totally awesome and have the best yoga channel that iv seen! :)",Juis Juis,2020-10-29T02:38:56Z,0

"for some months now i&#39;ve been accompanied by periods where i feel short of breath (not corona-related, doctor says it might well be anxiety). since this started, when doing yoga sometimes limbs of me will suddenly start feeling numb or, you know, have this tingly feeling. does anybody experience this also? like right now when i was just bowing down and then into crow, my feet and lower legs started tingling hard... i never had this before, so just wondering whether other people experience the same or know why this happens",J Grds,2020-10-03T16:44:14Z,0

"hello adriene! i don’t normally comment in any videos but i had to this time. i was doing the october yoga plan day 3, (and i have to add that i just started yoga two weeks ago!!) i figured, why not try the bakhasana too.

"Day 3 YWA Action. <br />What a joyful practice! I love knocking on heavens door, it&#39;s so fun.

I have just entered a super risk-taking season of my life (yay! having a blast but it&#39;s sometimes scary) and this was a perfect class for that!  AND I was able to do mulasana for the FIRST TIME!

"I&#39;m so excited that I&#39;m commenting here cause I need to share. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga on and off through the years and decided that, with the whole Covid-19 thing and needing to stay at home, I should get back on the mat (I&#39;ve been social distancing for two or three months now).<br />My arms have always been really weak and that was mainly the reason I would stop practicing, I would get disheartened and quit when I thought I had failed (I&#39;ve never been known to have a healthy mindset about stuff...). But this time I said no way, I&#39;m gonna keep it up, it&#39;s okay if I can&#39;t make it. Today marked the day I was finally able to do the crow pose and I have literally no idea when I became so strong - not only in the arms, but in the core too - but I&#39;m crying happy tears because I thought I would never be able to do a handstand or something like it. I&#39;m definitely never quitting again, I feel like I can do anything, even if it takes time!",Isabel Legrady,2020-05-27T02:23:33Z,0

Instead of Crow pose I made the practice my own and entered a Head Stand. Thanks Adriene for supporting my ability to find courage. Namaste,Sam Smith,2020-05-02T22:30:16Z,0
"Crow pose is honestly so terrifying to me, but I actually enjoyed the playtime and tried to be brave! Also, I&#39;m a little bow-legged and I&#39;m wondering when I stand feet together (really together), is it better for me to stay knees bent or to hyperextend and kind of have my knees pushing on one another? In terms of what feels good, I switch between the two, but neither seem particularly comfy",Pia D,2020-05-02T21:57:18Z,0
"Hello Adriene! Just started the May month today (one day behind but it&#39;s alright :) ). <br />I&#39;m 16 weeks pregnant, my doctor has advised that I could exercise if I wish to (obviously, nothing that will make me feel uncomfortable). I was wondering if you have certain instructions for pregnant ladies, or a special playlist maybe? Thank you",Tamar Kassabian,2020-05-02T21:54:32Z,0
"I&#39;m doing yoga with Adriene for over two months now, never commented before but I was always reading comments here after every video and I always founded great motivation on those comments.

"this was one of my favourites, but gotta be carful with that frog position when you lift your whole body with your writsts, I almost fell, i jumped in the front and prevented my from breaking something xD so gotta be careful with the writs, but that was such a good pose I had to tryit, I guess my arms are still a bit weak so i have to build more strenght :) my wrists are fine now, but I  was afraid when I feel upfront from doing that pose XD",TrueTotally,2020-05-02T20:29:02Z,0

"Currently doing my own at home retreat with meditation with music and your videos. I&#39;ve mixed between a at home retreat you did back in 2017 and the may practices  plus some I think are replenishing. My daughter who is 5 is doing it with me too. No TV, no phones, just meditation music, nature, mindfulness colouring and plenty of good food. Adriene  you do make me giggle. Finally after 4 years I&#39;ve  fully mastered the crow Pose, I genuinely  think it&#39;s due to I&#39;m so relaxed today. So nice to have a few days out of life as it&#39;s so hectic all the time even with covid! Thanks again. You&#39;re an angel x",Samy Southern,2020-05-02T18:52:51Z,1

"Take risks and challenge oneself! I loved this practice today... Do the things that make you happy more so than not. Embrace and be grateful of what you do have, be it mind, body, and soul. Mostly be a doer while still remembering to smell the roses along the way. Discover what brings you joy and then focus on that. Don&#39;t give into darkness that at times slithers through the cracks! Instead, breathe in fresh air, feel the salty water against your skin, effing live while you can, otherwise it will be taken before you ever got a chance to savor it...",Kurt Martine,2020-05-02T17:03:30Z,0
"ahhhh! So it’s meditation this month- I goal I really wanted to focus on. Now when I saw this risk takers video I was a little disappointed since I’ve done it so much before... when we got to crow practice, like always I thought “here we are again, when will I get this?” So I took a risk and just tried to focus in on what I was doing and I FLEW FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! I was only in my crow for a few seconds but it’s progress. I just can’t believe it. Thank you 🙏🏻",kristin willoughby,2020-05-02T16:57:50Z,0

"Yay Crow! Finally.  Seems a lot of people find it with this practice.  I think the thoughts and meditations leading up to that really seem to encourage us to let go of our own fears, and free the potential within.  And it made me really happy. Anyone not there yet, don&#39;t get down on yourself. I have lots of old injuries and it took me a long time to get here, and I might not even be able to hold it tomorrow.  So keep breathing, keep loving yourself, keep believing you matter. Love to all.",Al Orange,2020-05-02T08:35:59Z,1
"A bit tired and headachy this morning, so found the breathing and focus helpful. Balance not too bad but didn&#39;t extend to crow!

"This was an emotional practice for me today. A combination of yes I got this when I both managed to do tree pose with my foot right up on my thigh on both sides..Yay (I&#39;d previously only been able to do it with my foot on my calf) and then I also managed to do crow pose, even if just for a second..it felt like a feat, as I have been struggling to even get one foot off the ground. I am so proud of me..........to then also breaking down in tears when you broke into &quot;..lean on me, when you&#39;re not strong, and I&#39;ll be your friend&quot; song and when I was in forward fold. It seems to be reflecting just how I am feeling each day during this current global crisis, a climate of the unknown, of one minute feeling like I got this, I am strong, to feeling lost and unsure of anything.

"I DID THE CROW FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY AND ACTUALLY HELD IT FOR A FEW SECONDS!!!!!!!  <br /><br />also, how do you always know just the right thing to say????!

(Usually my lazy days) like WTH don&#39;t forget to say comment that so she knows. Oh shoot now I&#39;m not concentrating. Oh wait, it&#39;s okay. Remember what adriene says. Be nice to yourself it&#39;s okay to not be in full meditative states when doing yoga yet. &quot;   Hopefully you understand what I just wrote and can interpretate how much you have impacted my life in a huge way.. I used to be a self hating person. With lots of low self esteem and if I didn&#39;t do everything perfectly. I&#39;d never encourage myself, but instead punish myself. Once I started following your videos, something starting changing. In the beginning I thought I was fine. And I&#39;d laugh at people all about self love and all that self help stuff. <br /><br />Well over 5 months in, and I&#39;m witnessing myself change in ways I never thought possible or even realized was a thing. <br /><br /><br />Thank you from the bottom of my soul.

"TLDR: getting fired sucks, living off of your art is terrifying, yoga made me feel not so scared ❤️✨<br />So two days ago I got fired from my new job, fired for the first time ever. At the same time I’ve been prepping for an art show and got two different invitations to apply to other art happenings coming up later on. I’ve been super stressed attempting to balance the entire thing. So stressed to the point that my body has started to manifest physical symptoms and I had one of the worst panic attacks I’ve had in a long time three days ago. So after I was let go I completely broke down in my living room to my live in SO, he asked me what I wanted to do, what made me happy I said only art and meditation and yoga, that kind of stuff. To which he answered; then do that, I’ve got your back and you’re brave, you can do this. So after feeling bad for myself the last two days I’ve decided I’m going to give it a shot, take a risk and see how far my art can take me. <br />But, I knew I needed my mat... it’s been so hard just to get here and convince myself I am worthy of the work to self sooth and to grow. <br />I hit the mat today finally, and wept when you said I was brave. The acute fear I had about trying to branch out on my own works is much less severe, I feel like if I work consistently and with patience like I try to do with my self, maybe I can peruse my dream. My ankle and hip have unlocked (I have a pinched nerve that flares up if I’ve not been paying attention to it or am dealing with a load of stress) and I feel like I can finally breathe. And I’m going to try to work for myself  in the best ways that I can. <br />Thank you for always being here, Adriene ❤️ you truly are my hero. <br />PS. I almost kinda did crow, 🥳something I’ve not been able to quite master yet.",angela bleibtrey,2019-06-24T20:50:03Z,4

Hello Adriene from Jim...Bradford -West Yorkshire - UK.<br />Could I please politely ask if you would become a &#39;Brave Browser&#39; verified user. This way we can start to reward you with BAT - Brave attention tokens - in effect...I will pay you for watching your videos. Further to that you will still benefit from Youtube payments. I am not affiliated with either so absolutely no benefit to me if you choose not to get on this runaway train in terms of the way we will all do our banking and finances in the not too distant future. The only benefit to me is the most important one of all...not financial but will give me the chance to reward what you have so selflessly given thus far to my wife and I which has helped transformed our lives for so any reasons. I am an early Bitcoin adopter (2011) and have the last eight to nine years experience in all things Blockchain/crypto. With that in mind I hope you will be open minded with my request.,Jim Waddington,2019-06-11T13:54:48Z,0

"Ok, this is my favorite video of yours yet. Not only was it refreshing, it reminded me that it&#39;s ok to take risks from time to time not only on the mat, but in the real world. For example, crow&#39;s pose was always the toughest to me. After a few seconds of pushing myself to try it again, I was able to hold the pose for about fifteen seconds, no feet on the ground. After that, I didn&#39;t want the video to end as I wanted to try more risks. This is a very encouraging practice Adriene, so thank you so much",Erik Waldman,2019-06-10T19:36:41Z,0

"The timing of this video was PERFECT, Adrienne! Thank you so much. I&#39;ve gotten into the habit of refreshing the number of video views after every practice of yours so that I can see how many people practiced with me. No matter the video, I&#39;m always amazed to see that at least one other person was practicing with me. (This video was awesome because the number really went up!) I can&#39;t tell you how wonderful it feels to know that at that moment, I was practicing with other yogis from all around the world. So for anyone reading this who is feeling lonely or disconnected, know that I think of YOU with every practice! Thank you, Adrienne!!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3",Emily Holland,2019-06-10T01:15:32Z,0

I don&#39;t usually comment  but today is a special risky occasion. I all of sudden was able to hold crow with ease and length and it felt so powerful and it&#39;s all because I took that risk.

"After doing yoga nearly daily since January I&#39;ve gained 10 pounds! I was underweight before with bad posture and a lack of appetite due to my depression but after doing yoga for a few weeks I became really hungry so I listened to my body. Now those 10 pounds I needed to be at a healthy weight have showed up in my arm muscles, my abs, my bum, and my thighs. Riding my bike to work is easier now and I feel like I have a lot more power behind my movements in daily life ... and I&#39;m excited to be showing off my strong core at the beach instead of all my ribs! After I finished Dedicate I knew that yoga was something I needed to do for myself for the rest of my life and now my boyfriend is joining me on this journey too! Thank you so much Adriene for sharing your passion for yoga!",KaylaNoelle1,2019-06-09T22:30:27Z,543
"@Mrs. Shaver&#39;s Pages Yes! So glad it resonated with you! I definitely felt blamed for losing weight as if I did it on purpose for attention but my depression literally just steals the flavour and enjoyment from food. Nobody gave me any tools to maintain my appetite they just blamed and accused me. That shame just added to the issue until I was gaunt. Then of course I looked in the mirror and felt disgusting so it would ramp up my depression even more. Yoga really empowered me to believe that I could create some balance for myself and I have kept the weight on consistently ever since! I wish all the same success for you! Gaining or losing a significant amount of weight is hard but with consistency, you can make it happen!",KaylaNoelle1,2021-03-12T04:20:48Z,1

"Loved this practice! Thank you so much Adriene! ♥️😌 Finally i&#39;m feeling like i&#39;m getting somewhere with the crow pose, not there yet, but it looks like it might be actually achievable at some point! Any tips for the hard poses like crow and headstand? I feel like i&#39;m much better at the downward dogs, trees, warriors and your other classics (which is a great achievement for me, don&#39;t get me wrong!), but now i&#39;m wanting to take the next step and start practicing for the two that i find hard atm but definitely would love to master.

I&#39;m lucky to maintain, to hang on, to wake up, to do much of anything at all. But I definitely need courage. And I definitely could use some more balance.

A few hours later I looked up your exact words and I just found the right moment in the vid at once. “Just by trying I am doing great. The playtime becomes really valuable, not the end goal. The proces is actually where I became awesome and that I learned about myself”🙏🏽",Michelle de Heer,2019-06-09T13:05:53Z,6
"Hi Michelle, <br />That one sentence deeply touched me too. Often times we focus so much on the final result, that we forget to enjoy the journey.
