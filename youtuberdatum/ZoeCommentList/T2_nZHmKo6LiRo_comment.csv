"It’s so interesting hearing you talk about emetophobia as I suffer with it too, anxiety and panic attacks are all linked.

I have followed you for years and been a fan since the early phases of your channel.. I guess it is part of growing more mature that we need more privacy and in parallel we actually become more honest.. it is very natural in the process of change.. People who actually know you will totally understand that you are just developing into a wiser  human being. Loads of love :),Hajar Nait Hammou,2020-11-02T06:32:20Z,0

"I have severe emetophobia and I did not struggle with any type of sickness with my pregnancy. I have it worse with thinking about my child getting sick. Like pregnancy was a breeze. I’m great at willing myself not to get sick. But when it comes to my son, I’m out. I can’t. That thought sends me absolutely reeling. He’s 14 months now and the first time he spit up as a newborn was awful. I did get better, but now that he’s older, I have much more anxiety surrounding him getting sick. All that to say, I’m right there with you. I feel the struggle.",Emily Best,2020-11-02T05:17:44Z,0

I was the same way with emetophobia! It was something I would think about and be really scared.

So yes I still miss that time and just chillin&#39; with my YouTube friends, but I love to live my own live aswell.",TeenSquer,2020-10-29T13:36:11Z,7
"Been following since the beginning (when you were 19 and I was 16-17) and I must say you completely hit the nail on the head with describing old YouTube as cozy. I continue to come back to your channel every video to feel that cozy and safe vibe and you truly continue to provide that feeling for me - especially your videos with Mark! <br /><br />I love how open you’ve been with us over the years but I also really love how you have been able to set boundaries. Growing up watching you, we have all grown up together and I am so proud of who you have become and almost remained to be your true self!! <br />I am genuinely just happy for you Zoe and we all want to see you happy. I will continue to support and follow along as long as you want us to! You have changed and helped so many lives and it’s weird to say but I almost feel like coming to your channel is like meeting up with a lifelong friend.",Lauren Driscoll,2020-10-29T13:36:05Z,8

"Hi Zoe, I really struggle with emetophobia. I get anxiety and panic attacks due to the fear of being sick. I don’t mind anyone else’s sick etc. Just my own for some reason. I have begun to understand why I feel sick and how to prevent that and know I am much better however, I have found that how other people deal with it is super important. It’s so nice relating to someone! Xx",Amy Snodin,2020-10-29T13:34:01Z,11

"Hey Zoë, I normally never comment on your video’s but I wanted to say that I’m watching your video’s since the beginning. I do have to say that I miss those video’s of you shopping in Primark with Louise and than showing what you bought in your sunny garden back home. 💓 Of course I know that you got older and therefore you changed and that is super normal, but I loooooved those video’s so much!! They were such fun video’s and an escape for me to watch YouTube. A few years later you began to vlog and those are still my faves, they were always longer than 45 min with so much fun things and addressing serious subjects like anxiety, which helped me so much and I want to thank you for it (I still watch them sometimes hihi). 💓 I still love you and your video’s and I got older with you and I hope to still watch your video’s in a couple of years when you’re again in a new time of your life. Love you lots 🥰💓",Eefje van der Gronden,2020-10-29T13:30:04Z,4
"I’ve been here since the start! Apart from the fact I’ve got a newer channel but me in real life has been watching since I was a teenager. Growing up watching Panacea81 to then progressing on to you and the OGs. I rarely keep up with YouTube these days, maybe because I’m now a business owner and actually have work to do 😂 but also because I just don’t enjoy the atmosphere anymore. <br />I stick with your vlogs, sortedfood (I’m a foodie), emmasrectangle and James &amp; Carys. That’s it and that’s my happy YouTube bubble 💕 P.s if you could re- release the zoella bontanic eau - I’d really appreciate it 😂😍",Georgia Beech,2020-10-29T13:28:38Z,1

You should dip a cotton pad or cotton wool in freshly boiled hot water from the kettle in a small bowl with like half a teaspoon of salt dissolved in it. Then gently swipe the cotton pad over your stye therefore cleaning the area. It gets rid of the stye so quickly sometimes over night. Works every time for me,Noshin Rouf,2020-10-29T13:24:34Z,3

Pregnancy vomiting is not the same as when you&#39;re sick (at least for me) I&#39;m really good at not vomiting and don&#39;t like it either but this you really can&#39;t avoid but it&#39;s so light and quick and then it&#39;s over. I cried the first time because as I said I&#39;m usually great at not vomiting and I didn&#39;t want to but it was so not a big deal and then it only happened a few more times like maybe 5 in total and was like an expert and unbothered by it by then. So I hope this helps anyone who worries about pregnancy vomiting that not all first trimesters are hell some people don&#39;t even have nausea at all! X,J. P.,2020-10-29T13:21:02Z,24

She grown up to a honest , genuine and caring. Zoe you always been my fave to watch since 2013 . I understand the mental health ( I do suffer anxiety ) but you teach me so much . I’m actually happy that you do confident sharing things which quite personal ( especially with menstrual cup story ) but most girl go through that . I love your confidence to share these .

I hate vomiting and can stop myself from doing it. I’ve had two babies and did not vomit either pregnancy. Not everyone gets morning sickness and I feel like me being a person who rarely vomits meant I was just able to hold it down. Don’t get me wrong first trimester was still hard with fatigue but just wanted you to know being pregnant doesn’t necessarily mean you will vomit and it’s worth it for the end result 😉,Bianca Polino,2020-10-29T12:10:49Z,0

"I&#39;m 38 and I&#39;m so lucky my emetophobia only came on whilst I was pregnant with my second (and last)child - or I might not have had them :( <br />I think it was triggered by my first little girl going through norovirus whilst I was pregnant and I was TERRIFIED of catching it because she caught it bad. It has since made every winter of the rest of my life in a state of anxiety (I say winter - cold and bug season) ... I have a black pug too :) ..he&#39;s been sick a few times and that hasn&#39;t bothered me but I would feel exactly the same if my OH or kids caught it. Resonate a lot with what you said.

Sorry if i scare anyone.. when i was giving birth i didnt even care about being sick. <br />When he was born i got scared when he would spit up, but that got better as well! I am not as scared anymore as time gone by, and i know so many women can do it too!<br />So for anyone that is scared to get pregnant, i know its scary, but you can do it!

"I relate entirely to the phobia. I’m around the same age and very interested in having a child within the next 5ish years but it fills me with paralyzing fear sometimes knowing so much can go wrong. When I found out the illness Kate Middleton had can happen to “any” woman, I had repeated obsessive panic episodes. What I learned from my friend is that when you’re committed to bringing a life into this world and you want to carry the baby yourself, something flips in your mind where you go, “okay, this is the only way I can do this. I accept I’m going to have to deal with this. I’ll surrender sometimes to not being able to control it and remember everything will be okay anyway.” It’s obviously easier said than done but even hearing this thought process from someone I really trust made a notable difference in my outlook. Still definitely have my phobia but working on it.",RespectedProfessional,2020-10-29T11:20:58Z,0

Emetophobia and pregnancy TW- <br />I know how you feel. I&#39;m 21 and have been struggling with this since I was about 15. I&#39;ve always wanted a family and decided to say &#39;fuck it&#39; and not let it hold me back (easier said than done I know). I&#39;m currently 33 weeks pregnant with a  little boy (Due Dec 15) and somehow I had no morning sickness! &lt;3 Nervous about birth and I know pregnancy is different for everyone- don&#39;t get me wrong my phobia does still affect me daily but I&#39;m just trying my hardest every day.,Molly James,2020-10-29T09:50:41Z,0
Worth noting there have been times when smells etc have made me feel ill but I always had ginger nuts and polos/ water with me! And chewing gum. Always calmed me down and made me focus on the minty taste etc (and ginger calms your stomach),Molly James,2020-10-29T09:52:35Z,0

"Awr I remember the older days, I loved YouTube then, this video felt nostalgic I really liked it.

"I feel like in the &quot;cozy days&quot; spending time on social media wasn&#39;t &quot;mainstream&quot; if that makes sense 😅 like most people didn&#39;t spend a big chunk of their time watching youtube. I remember not having many friends at all who also like &quot;watched youtubers&quot; where as now it feels so strange when you meet someone who doesnt have social media or watch youtube and they&#39;re completely the odd one out. I totally understand what you mean by back in the day youtube was an escape whereas now people want to escape from social media. Back in the day if you didnt have a buzzing social life, you spent your time on youtube... whereas now people think of their social life as strongly linked to social media (deciding where to visit based on the instagram pictures, or spending their time putting effort into getting more followers). Its a completely different youtube-life dynamic now for both the youtubers and subscribers.... craaaaaazy 😅",DeanyBean12,2020-10-29T09:27:33Z,118

"Shows so much strength to do a q and a like this! I couldn&#39;t agree with you more about keeping private about your future of starting a family. People asking when you are having a baby can be so upsetting when its not happening or when your worried about it and it&#39;s so rude!! The first trimesters hard but like yourself I somehow manage to not be sick when I need to if that brings you any comfort and generally if you snack lots the nausea is better. If you are worried that there might be problems when you want to try, I would recommend getting your fertility checked out at a clinic, they can do tests that show your egg reserve and check for cysts and things. My husband and I decided to let it happen but it never did so we eventually went onto have Ivf and it worked but I think our age helped enormously so it&#39;s good to know if there any any issues so it can happen when you want it to.

"Emetophobia! I have the exact same feelings. Actually, I managed to spend 20 years (!!!!) without throwing up even though I know that there are occasions where I should&#39;ve. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s also our body protecting us. But last January I got a bug from my friends child and it was so intense I ended up throwing up a little. I say a little because I had a major panic attact and my poor husband had to clean up after me and also calm me down. It was the most traumatic experience of my life! And I&#39;m in the same state as you are. Terrified of both getting the morning sickness when I get pregnant and also even more terrified about the thought of my baby getting sick. The thought of being a horrible mother because of this is so depressing and scary. I&#39;m still happy to know I&#39;m not the only one feeling this way!

"🙋‍♀️ also had the fear of being sick and I have no idea where it came from but started at about 16 until I was 22. It really affected my eating habits, or what I was thinking when eating at a restaurant. The first thing I would do when eating out is almost scope out where the toilet was ‘just in case’ I needed to be sick, even though I never ever was. I never explored it with anyone but the fear of being sick really impacted me and how I lived my life. I remember even making sure I sat on the end of cinema seats or lecture theatres so I could escape (to be sick) if I needed to. It was 100% mental and it’s sad that it took so long to escape that mental trap of worrying about being sick even though there was no experience that triggered it. I wouldn’t even say it’s stopped really but it’s not impacted my life as much as it used to 5 years ago. I’ve just got more comfortable",Hannah Burt,2020-10-29T08:38:10Z,0

"I totally get that people have to stop asking about babies. But I’m pregnant at the moment, 14 weeks, and I had such a rough first trimester. I’m nauseous all the freaking time, I have never threw up so many times in my life. It has been hard. BUT, knowing that you have a little wonder inside you, it makes it all worth it. It really does.. also because you know it well end at some time, it’s not like a permanent situation. 🧡 All that besides. You are such great people, so kind, so empathetic. If you miss the cosy times on youtube, why don’t go back to creating sometimes content like back then? Vlogs, but also DIY’s, crafting, baking, hauls, decorating, styling, gardening,...<br />Sending you much love<br /><br />Ps, random fact, but I notice you often have gum in your mouth, just wanted to let you know one of the main ingredients of gum is a sort of plastic (that’s why it doesn’t disappear if it’s on the street), and plastic leaks chemicals that messes with you health and hormones. So if you care about that, I would avoid plastic as much as possible, especially around food, drinks and gum ;) xxx",Amber Fox,2020-10-29T08:15:59Z,0

"Zoe,<br />I’ve loved you forever. Your right, people should not ask about the baby situation. It’s always assumed it’s easy until your in it. But hear this, sometimes you won’t have sickness. I didn’t have any sickness with my first child but I did almost die from sepsis after. And woth now that I am pregnant with my second, I cannot tell you the crippling fear that I feel. BUT this pregnancy is already completely different in that I’ve been hospitalised with extreme sickness twice. It’s part of my everyday now and it’s hard and difficult and one of the worrisome and most uncomfortable things I’ve even done BUT the end result is amazing and in the grand scheme of things the length of suffering far outways the length of the end result. It’s short term and it will be absolutely fine. I beg you please do not let fear of things dictate or have a say in living your life because I promise you, it will be a regret when your older. I understand crippling fear, I feel it every day. If you ever have any questions or need any advice we are all here for you. We’re all strangers I know but if I can help one person from my bad experiences then it’s all been worth it. I promise you it will all be fine, you’ll be amazed at how truly strong you really are. <br /><br />Also, you’ve probably got a lot of people mentioning Christmas and I have before so please don’t feel pressured. We never get bored of you. You’re like a best friend we don’t hear from for a while but when we do it’s just like yesterday we last saw you. X",Leanie’s lovelies vlogs,2020-10-29T08:14:46Z,0

"One of my closest friends has the being sick thing, we’re 21, I’ve known her since we were 14 and we go out all the time and she’s literally never thrown up. She’s had her stomach pumped before and sometimes she can’t walk or she’ll pass out. She’s so scared of being sick that she won’t let her body get rid of the alcohol. Most of the time she’s not even <i>that</i> drunk, she’s just gone to fast and when most of us would throw up and stop drinking or go and eat something, she can’t do that.

Kids are sick alot so you&#39;d need to really work on that before having a baby my husband can&#39;t stand sick but having kids has actually really helped even though he can&#39;t clean it up he doesn&#39;t panic like he used to. You will get really sick throughout pregnancy but thinking about I&#39;m doing this for someone that you will love so much will make it so worth it  and I think motherly instinct helps so much like I couldn&#39;t stand bogeys like I&#39;d freak out now I can cope with it it&#39;s so strange but you completely change because the love is so strong. You would be such great parents you are so knowledgeable and grown but never feel pressure to have kids because others want you too.,Bex kent,2020-10-29T07:54:56Z,0

"I have the exact same with emetaphobia and panic attacks. Since lockdown it’s got much worse again and often feels uncontrollable. I’ve tried hypnotherapy and for me personally it did nothing, but after many different types of therapy over a few years I got some decent results. I think it’s one of those phobias that sometimes people don’t take seriously, especially when they’re the sorts of people who maybe go out and drink too much and therefore are sick regularly, so to them it means nothing. But you’re absolutely not the only one, and there is definitely help out there :) x",Rebekah Kennett,2020-10-29T07:38:28Z,0

Is it right after you upload? Do you wait a day? How far back from when something is posted do you read the comments on it?

"Questions and comments: How different is it to work with your brother around. Do you feel a confidence decline or like you have a hard time taking yourself as seriously when he&#39;s there?  <br />Comment: I enjoy the personal posts that you used to do but only IF you feel ok sharing. I thing it&#39;s really what was the charm of your channel and then your interest in home and garden stuff with decorating, shopping, exploring shops, shopping with friends, exploring your current visual preferences that aren&#39;t part of your product development but just personal joys of living in a day for you that are really basic. I love that you&#39;re got so many business projects but also the charm of your videos isn&#39;t in the promos of your products but in learning about who YOU are as a person and just relating to your daily life on a basic non biz level. Like what you enjoy reading, what you wish you could read if you have time, what small pleasures make you zen down when you feel overwhelmed and or self confidence declines. What causes your self confidence declines and besides thickening your skin, what helps to feel confident and less fear on a daily basis. What is your comfort zone now? What do you wish you could leave behind with regards to your position of celeb and fame? Is it attention, having to avoid going out and having to hit off-hours outings, privacy issues, etc. Also question, what do you do to protect your income (not for me b/c I&#39;m poverty level) but for people who do have income that requires management and investing and etc. Question: how do you think you will do this year with visiting family and do you feel divided while visiting parents divorced, extended family etc? Have you considered having Xmas at your house and inviting people in a series of groups so that&#39;s all still safe like a Christmas with Alfie&#39;s fam, then a xmas with your dad, one with your mom and grandparents,? How will you feel this year with less social events in general? Is it better and more relaxing but do you find as much of a creative outlet at home?  And I wanted to say I can relate as an introvert to liking these small groups and one on ones without as much general public interaction b/c of the pandemic. I don&#39;t wish the pandemic but I do enjoy the more intimate exchanges. :)  Your chats aren&#39;t boring , your personal development and interests and struggles are interesting and it&#39;s fun to watch someone both work on and solve their personal issues as well as failing sometimes or rerouting your direction! xo",Amy Tinsky,2020-10-29T07:12:29Z,1

I’ve never had a huge following on any social media platform, but I’ve noticed myself just taking disposable camera pics more than phone ones, or posting a photo once a week, not telling everyone every single life-update that occurred etc etc. It’s lovely to see you do a sit down video!!

"I have a daughter. And people ask me, haunt me, about no 2. <br />Now I don’t and I do want another. <br /><br />But my pregnancy was difficult, scary and a struggle. <br />It took time to conceive. <br />Morning sickness the first trimester 🤷🏻‍♀️ that would be a dream. I had nausea and fatigue every hour of my first 3 weeks of pregnancy. <br />Then the voming... it snuck up on me at any time of the day... from the moment i woke in the morning until I fell asleep in the evening. At least 7 times a day for several weeks. It didn’t stop until about week 15-16. It felt like forever. It then returned for the last few weeks of pregnancy before I started fainting, falling and my heart raced. <br />Then early emergency c-section. <br /><br />I’ve been more honest when the question comes up. When people haunt me about it. <br />I tell them it’s not what I’m here for. I am my own person and motherhood isn’t the only thing I’m meant for. <br />I feel so blessed with my life as it is. People always crave more of each other.",Jessica,2020-10-29T05:59:55Z,0
Question: What is your stance on global warming? Do you think companies are taking enough responsibility?

I started watching when I was in secondary school and now i have just completed my degree.

LOVE your response to the never-ending baby questions! You shouldn’t feel like you have to even say anything at all with Q&amp;As. People are selfish and don’t think about how the question impacts people as they don’t know if they can even have children or just struggle with the idea of having them/being pregnant. My first pregnancy I had sickness but not in the horrific way(thankfully mild) and second had nothing. Everyone’s different and all you should focus on is the end bit if you naturally want children and whenever it happens/if it happens then you just take extra care of yourself if you don’t feel yourself. You’d be growing a human and there will be tough times - just get Alfie to give you plenty of back and feet rubs 😂,Sarah Reast,2020-10-29T04:52:37Z,1

Was there a book that sparked your love of reading? Did your family’s reading choices influence you? Did you have any great experiences reading in school? 💛📚📖,LauraJ7713,2020-10-29T04:41:55Z,0

"I totally know what you mean about the baby/pregnancy thing. I always wanted to be a mummy. I never thought I would have any trouble and never thought of it as something scary. I found out I was pregnant in March and I was absolutely terrified, I just had all these new fears and I had hip dysplasia and that couldn&#39;t be sorted while I was pregnant but also go worse because of the pregnancy. I ended up suffering a loss, which was something I never thought about and didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to deal with something like that. I found out I was pregnant in lockdown and isolating with my parents and not my partner so I didn&#39;t even tell him because I wanted to tell him in person. It was just such a difficult time in ways I never could have dreamed. I&#39;m hoping to start trying again in the new year though so fingers crossed 🤞 🙏 😊 💖",lilyrose mitchell,2020-10-29T04:30:53Z,1

"I had emetophobia from the age of 6 until the start of this year (I&#39;m 24!). I had my first baby just shy of a month ago now and pregnancy cured my fear of throwing up. I had morning sickness pretty much every day and knowing it was my body growing my baby made it a positive experience. And since, It doesn&#39;t scare me! Don&#39;t fear pregnancy because of that. I did and it was the best thing 💛💛",Rachel East,2020-10-29T03:56:20Z,0

"I have emetophobia - before being pregnant, I hadn’t thrown up for over 10 years. I have had panic attacks often. I am more anxious of people around me being sick and me catching it than anything else. <br />I had hyperemesis while pregnant, was sick the whole time from 6 weeks to the minute my boy was born. I have to say, I was not anxious while pregnant, I avoided throwing up but obviously I couldn’t help it. <br />I thought maybe it would’ve helped me get over it, but no it hasn’t 😂 although just a positive that I was okay pregnant, even dealing with throwing up! <br />And baby spit up doesn’t mind me, other people’s kids does.",B Gray,2020-10-29T03:53:26Z,0

And, of course, this only circles around to making me feel MORE ill. Logically, I know it&#39;s stupid, but what can you do when your brain fires your fight or flight response inappropriately! And yet lol, I have never thrown up in public in my life? Sometimes, you just feel so insane haha.<br /><br />I&#39;m fine with my pets vomiting, and I&#39;m actually fine vomiting myself as long as I&#39;m at home (I still dislike it, but I don&#39;t get nervous), but I get really anxious if I hear or see other people vomit, and even movies gross me out sometimes.",baykinz,2020-10-29T02:36:21Z,0

I put on my headset and just listen to you for 2 hrs straight (w/o watching bc it also makes me sick watching videos while on car ride but yoyr voice and knowing that I love your videos was so comforting, it wasnt music but your voice truly).. that was the time I truly appreciated the comfort you give. Love you.",khal mss,2020-10-29T02:18:15Z,1

"hi zoe, loved the catch up- felt very old school YouTube :)) don’t usually comment but thought I’d just say, i think its not so much about if people care or not about knowing/hearing/experiencing your life through YouTube (I do!) , and more that we find so much solace and reassurance in it. I think as humans there’s so much solidarity, a craving and an importance in sharing things especially when its super vulnerable, and is probably one of the many reasons why u have such a huge following :)) xx",Mary Buchanan,2020-10-29T02:15:39Z,0

In your bedroom and you showed us how you styled your long hair. <br />I had just had a baby and I was struggling with postpartum really bad. I hated the way I looked, hated my limp thick some what wavy hair. Etc but my hubby and I had our first date night and I wanted to ‘try’ something new. <br />You showed us how to do a plat headband thing. Lol <br />I tried it and it turned out.

I’ve not thrown up since I was in third grade and I’m almost 19 now. I’ve stopped myself from getting sick so many times and I don’t know how.

Question: what would you say is your most cherished memory throughout your entire life? ♥️<br /><br />Also!

"my anxiety is also based around being sick, but when i’m anxious i’ll throw up and have always been like that (i’m 24 now) and i’ve taught myself kinda to stop myself being sick which makes my anxiety worse, it’s hard to explain to people when they don’t experience it too! i have such a fear of being pregnant just because of the chance of having morning sickness which is horrible and i wish wasn’t the case. i’ve watched your videos since your “say yes” video as i was trying to find other people who have anxiety so i can help understand my own and i’ve found comfort in your videos as i relate so much to you and i look at you as inspiration to become more than my anxiety. when you said about people’s videos being cozy back when, i agree! i feel like you’ve stayed that person too, watching your videos always make me feel cozy and relaxed and helps ground me, in the most complimentary way you’re very “normal” which is so refreshing to me and something i love about you. thank you for sharing your life with us ✨❤️",Emily Green,2020-10-29T01:48:36Z,0

It is crazy to think about how long you’ve been doing YT. I’ve been watching since 2008- when you lived with Joe and did purse and hair videos. You had SO MUCH HAIR- I feel like maybe you hadn’t cut it in a long time back then too??? I bought a tangle teezer way back then because you <b>influenced</b> me :) that was also during the time when you used to write personal blogs. It’s actually pretty interesting to have watched you grow (I’m a few years older than you). I remember when you started baking but didn’t have much experience. There was also a video in your apartment with the skylight when you started talking about “home products” even though you hadn’t really done it before and you were unsure how much interest you had in making videos about that kind of stuff.

I started going to therapy at 10 because after my parent&#39;s divorce I couldn&#39;t fall asleep at my dad&#39;s house without throwing up, and I also had a lot of anxiety as a varsity track athlete and would often throw up before races.  It&#39;s just fascinating to see how differently people&#39;s anxieties manifest.",Kira Wise,2020-10-28T19:40:54Z,235

I&#39;m with you with the sick thing! I feel like mines really selfish as it comes down to the fear of me being sick ! I haven&#39;t been sick since junior school ( I&#39;m in college now ) . Sick makes me feel really uncomfortable but if I know someone&#39;s sick becuase of pain or food i can cope . If one on my friends has been sick ( like a  bug )  and cones to college I literally wont go in . But like if babys are sick I am okay as baby&#39;s get sick all the time and it&#39;s unlikely that I will . It controls the things I eat for sURE .,Alissa Mai,2020-10-28T19:33:26Z,9

I&#39;m so grateful to have found so many positive people on youtube that literally saved me from being a depressed and anxious person. This might sound exagerated but it&#39;s true: Youtube and specially you Zoe helped me to create a little warm bubble where I could go to feel better and learn how to do makeup, how to be nicer to people, kinder, and more lighthearted (and also how to speak english! Actually, sorry if i&#39;m a bit sketchy with my writing). I know that a lot of my current self was somehow inspired by you and other positive influencers. Thank you so much for what you gave me and keep giving us. Love from Italy :) &lt;3",Letizia Phoenix,2020-10-28T19:27:19Z,16

Thank you for the update Zoe x I also suffer with anxiety. Mine was diagnosed mid March before lock down. My main trigger was my job because I was put into situations that I was uncomfortable with when dealing the customers social workers and etc. It got so bad that my GP actually signed me off work for 3 weeks at the beginning of October. Which helped and made me come to the decision of actually leaving my job and finding a new one that’s less hours at the moment for a fresh start 👍,RedLadyBug 91,2020-10-28T19:26:49Z,8

I used to watch you’re videos ALL the time but kind of lost contact for the last couple of month. I used to love you’re videos for you’re honesty and rawness. It always felt like watching a best friend. When I read the Titel of the video I felt soooo thrown back to that time and just had to watch it. I understand that sometimes it can be very hard to be so open and vulnerable online. Especially with how many followers you’ve gained over the years. Very happy you feel confident enough to be so open again. Missed you!!! xxx,Katharina K,2020-10-28T19:23:46Z,25
