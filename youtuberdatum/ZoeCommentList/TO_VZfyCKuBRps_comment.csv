A good card game is spoons. Not gunna explain it but it’s fast paced and each round takes like 2 minutes.,Alexandra Herrera,2019-12-24T15:43:47Z,0
My friends and I play this game called Mao. It&#39;s a game that has rules that aren&#39;t supposed to be explained or spoken. You can google all the rules. All you need is a deck of cards. Certain cards or suits have rules that go along with them. The goal is to get rid of all your cards while trying not to break any of the rules (resulting in penalty cards).,Katie Rose Ford,2019-12-24T15:39:15Z,1

"card games: there&#39;s a great one that when I google is called mose, but my family has always called snowflake. Hearts and crazy 8s are other great classics. Lastly, euchre. I live in Michigan, euchre is serious business here. You have to make a special deck, but it&#39;s made with standard cards.<br /><br /><br />Fast paced table games: Sushi Go, Zombie Dice, Get Bit, LRC (Left Right Center).

As you love cobra paw and dobble. I would highly highly recommend jungle speed. It’s fast paced and competitive. There is a 20th anniversary addition (green box) but I love the original (yellow ish box) more. It’s like snap with but with special action cards and a totem pole. It’s great in a group of about 6 but I’ve played it with more than 20 in the past (needed a few sets of cards). Also we changed one of the rules from hand on the bottom to flight for the win (you’ll understand if you get the game). Anyway I LOVE IT <br /> and you NEED IT.,Lizzie Duffy,2019-12-18T17:04:56Z,2

"My favorite card game is garbage which can be played with 2+ people.<br /><br />You deal 10 cards to each player and set it up face down in a row or two if want to take up less space. The remaining deck is placed in the middle. <br /><br />The object of the game is to be the first player to line up your cards in a sequence starting with the ace.<br />The player left of the dealer goes first by drawing the top card from the deck. In the first round each player has 10 cards. The cards are numbered 1 to 10 starting from the left. When a numbered card is drawn, the card is placed in the corresponding spot. <br /><br />For example, a 5 drawn will be put face up in the fifth spot on your row. The face down card in that spot is flipped up and placed accordingly in your row and so on. When the player can no longer make a move, discard the current card. The next player to the left can choose to take the top discard, or draw the top card of the deck. The kings are wildcards and can be put in any spot. The jacks and queens are garbage and are discarded when picked up. Aces are used for the 1 spot. <br /><br />Once a player has flipped up all his/her cards, each other player gets 1 more turn. All the players that were able to flip up all 10 cards will only be dealt 9 cards in the next round, and will only need to get a sequence of 1 to 9. Players that did not flip up all the cards will have to play the next round with 10 cards again and you keep going until someone gets down to zero.",HeyItsMeg,2019-12-18T17:01:42Z,6

"Is Shithead the same as Bullshit, where you get rid of cards face down in a pile in the middle of the players and declare what you’re putting down eg 3 Queens, but it can be anything you want and if someone thinks that’s not possible they can say Bullshit. If correct, the person putting down the cards gets them all and if they’re wrong the challenger gets them all. Aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards.",Louisa Coote,2019-12-18T16:56:04Z,1

"Bingo and around the clock are classic games to play with cards.<br />Bingo - each player gets 5 cards each which are dealt face down so only they can see them. Place the rest of the cards in a pile and pick up the first number, if you have that card you place it down. If you already have more than one card with the same number when the cards are dealt they can be put down straight away, the winner is the first person to place all their cards down",Amanda Stapleton,2019-12-18T16:54:31Z,4
